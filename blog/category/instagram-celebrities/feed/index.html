								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram beauty bloggers pioneered the upheaval of an entire industry. Many of them got their starts on Youtube and then shifted to Instagram, but there’s no denying that these names are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">big</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Remember when nobody knew what contour meant? The beauty industry was revitalized by beauty bloggers. Whether it has a shelf life is a different question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As 2019 draws to a close, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of beauty blogger drama that has called into question whether or not this is still a sustainable industry. It may seem that the heyday of the beauty blogger is over, but a quick look at the most followed of them proves that’s not the case. Many of the people we know and love are still going strong today, and even expanding into other business ventures. Let’s take a look at the most followed Instagram beauty bloggers in 2019.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/badgalriri/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a> (75 million followers)</span></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ok, we admit this might be cheating a little, since most people know her for her music. But with the launch of Rihanna’s makeup line, Fenty Beauty, not only has she made history as an ultra-inclusive, ultra-diverse businesswoman, she’s also amassed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an Instagram presence. Rihanna herself currently sits at 75 million followers, while the official Fenty Beauty account has 8 million of its own followers. It&#8217;s celebrated for its wide array of skin tone shades available and great highlighter. She&#8217;s also branching into lingerie and inclusive fashion. We can&#8217;t wait to see what she does next. </span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1322 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.27.31-AM-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="197" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.27.31-AM-300x197.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.27.31-AM-768x505.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.27.31-AM-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.27.31-AM.jpg 1794w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hudabeauty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Huda Kattan</a> (39 million followers)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It comes as no shock that Huda is one of the first beauty bloggers to grace this list. She’s an American-born, Dubai-based makeup artist who’s turned her Instagram following into gold &#8211; literally, with the development of her beauty empire. She&#8217;s known for ultra-glam looks and her down-to-earth personality. Huda also loves shining the light on up-and-coming beauty bloggers on her Instagram page. With a following of 39 million, Sephora has to fight to keep her products in stock. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamescharles/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">3. James Charles</a> (15 million followers) </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Charles is a well-known makeup artist that again got his start on Youtube. Known for his eyebrows and dramatic looks, he was Covergirl’s first-ever “Cover Boy”.  He’s an advocate for the LGBT community and has been seen at the Met Gala, and most recently at NY fashion week! His enigmatic greeting of &#8220;Hi, sisters!&#8221; has captured the hearts of many of his loyal fans. </span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1323 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.32.49-AM-300x165.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="165" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.32.49-AM-300x165.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.32.49-AM-768x422.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.32.49-AM-1024x562.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.32.49-AM.jpg 1632w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you know Jeffree Star from his MySpace days or from his influencer career, he’s one Instagram beauty blogger you’re sure to remember. Even though he&#8217;s had his fair share of controversy, Jeffree’s punkish, glamorous style is so appealing that he has a following of 14 million and has seen a successful launch of his own makeup line. </span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1383 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jeffreestar-instagram-300x193.jpg" alt="Jeffreestar Instagram" width="300" height="193" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jeffreestar-instagram-300x193.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jeffreestar-instagram-768x493.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jeffreestar-instagram-1024x657.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jeffreestar-instagram.jpg 1866w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.instagram.com/zoesugg/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Zoe Sugg (9 million followers)</span></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoe Sugg a.k.a “Zoella” is known as the queen of British beauty bloggers, and it’s clear to see why. She rose to beauty blogger prominence quickly in the early 2010s, largely due to her pleasant personality and eye for style. Since then, Zoe has launched not only her own bath and beauty products, but also written several books. Most recently she&#8217;s branched out into app-making with her fellow-Youtuber boyfriend, Alfie Deyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaclyn Hill is one of the people who started it all on Youtube. She’s been posting beauty videos on Youtube almost as long as Youtube has been around! When you think of beauty bloggers, hers is definitely one of the first to come to mind. Jaclyn has gone on to have several successful collaborations with brands like MAC and Becca. Her own beauty line, Jaclyn Hill cosmetics, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ByF7PAMA7yE/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">launches this year.</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MannyMUA is another maker of history in being the first boy to rep a makeup brand &#8211; but his is Maybelline! One of the original Youtube makeup artists, he still keeps his channel up with a strong focus on beauty, but branches into other types of videos with his friends and family as well. He shows off his creative, timeless looks on Instagram regularly.</span></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kathleenlights/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. Kathleen Lights (3 million followers)</span></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathleen Lights has been making videos for a long time, and that’s translated into Instagram success. She posts tutorials and reviews of beauty products on her Youtube and Instagram, and she’s got a following of 3 million for it.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1387 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kathleenlights-300x220.jpg" alt="@kathleenlights Instagram" width="300" height="220" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kathleenlights-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kathleenlights-768x564.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kathleenlights-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kathleenlights.jpg 1626w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Desi Perkins&#8217; Kardashian-esque style and makeup tutorials made her one of Youtube&#8217;s favorite beauty bloggers in 2013. She posts beauty tutorials as well as vlogs on her Youtube channel. Although today she focuses on more natural looks and fashion, she’s kept her Instagram following of 3 million. We are very jealous of her vacation pictures. She&#8217;s got her aesthetic down pat.</span></p>
<h2><img class="size-medium wp-image-1325 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.44.59-AM-300x199.jpg" alt="A post from beauty blogger Desi Perkins" width="300" height="199" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.44.59-AM-300x199.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.44.59-AM-768x511.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.44.59-AM-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-29-at-11.44.59-AM.jpg 1594w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><a href="https://www.instagram.com/glamlifeguru/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. Tati Westbrook (2 million followers)</span></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tati got her start a bit later than some of the other beauty bloggers on our list. But the Internet still loves her as Glamlifeguru. Her honest personality and unbiased reviews of beauty products have cemented her in place as one of the top beauty bloggers.</span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1388 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tatiwestbrook-glamlifeguru-300x192.jpg" alt="Tati Westbrook @glamlifeguru" width="300" height="192" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tatiwestbrook-glamlifeguru-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tatiwestbrook-glamlifeguru-768x492.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tatiwestbrook-glamlifeguru-1024x656.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tatiwestbrook-glamlifeguru.jpg 1870w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jackieaina/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14. Jackie Aina (1.4 million followers)</span></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie Aina is a breath of fresh air to the beauty blogger world. Her fun-loving personality is on display in all her videos, and she’s an outspoken advocate for black women in the beauty industry. In a word, she is one fierce woman. She currently has 1.4 million followers on Instagram, but following the launch of her palette with Anastasia Beverly Hills, we’re sure she can expect more!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mimi Choi’s page will freak you out, because she’s known for creating unbelievably trippy optical illusions entirely with makeup. Seriously, her work is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">amazing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She’s one of the only people on this list who doesn’t have a Youtube channel, either &#8211; she’s built up her following on Instagram alone. </span></p>

<h2>Beauty Bloggers Are Here to Stay</h2>
<p>If you thought beauty bloggers were a thing of the past, think again. Instagram and Youtube revolutionized the beauty industry, and the amount of successful beauty bloggers proves that people can&#8217;t get enough. Instagram is a perfect platform to share looks and tutorials with the rest of the world, and they&#8217;ve figured that out. With huge followings that are only growing, we don&#8217;t think beauty bloggers are going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>The top bloggers in 2019 are pretty much all Youtube veterans, but many of them are shifting away from Youtube to their own business ventures. From their own cosmetic lines to apps to bath products, these aren&#8217;t just bloggers, they&#8217;re also entrepreneurs. That leaves us wondering what the next wave of beauty bloggers to pick up the mantel will be. If beauty bloggers can survive all this time, we&#8217;re confident they always will.</p>

<h2>Who to Follow on Instagram &#8211; Comedy</h2>
<p>Finally, we have comedy. Compared to the other topics mentioned, comedy accounts are a more niche genre of content &#8211; yet garner millions of followers nonetheless. Being the subjective field that it is, such profiles vary in its post types; encompassing memes, skits, text images, or simply humorous photographs.</p>
<h3>h3h3productions</h3>
<p>Though they found their claim to fame through their YouTube channel of the same name, this couple&#8217;s Instagram account is no less hilarious in content.</p>

<p>Operated by Ethan Klein (comedy partner and husband of the show&#8217;s other half, Hila Klein) this Instagram offers an extension of comedic material from their already successful YouTube series. However, his posts remain just as entertaining for non-subscribers of the channel.</p>
<div id="attachment_986" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-986" class="size-full wp-image-986" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h3h3productions-comedy-post.jpg" alt="h3h3productions Instagram post" width="1000" height="726" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h3h3productions-comedy-post.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h3h3productions-comedy-post-300x218.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/h3h3productions-comedy-post-768x558.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-986" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of h3h3productions (Instagram account).</p></div>

<h3>Someecards</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve wandered the internet long enough, you&#8217;ve likely seen this format before: elegant, typical looking e-cards that offer sarcastic &#8211; rather than inspirational &#8211; lines or greetings.</p>
<div id="attachment_1011" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1011" class="size-full wp-image-1011" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/who-to-follow-on-instagram-someecards.png" alt="Who to follow on Instagram - someecards" width="1000" height="771" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/who-to-follow-on-instagram-someecards.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/who-to-follow-on-instagram-someecards-300x231.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/who-to-follow-on-instagram-someecards-768x592.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1011" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of someecards (Instagram account).</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you wondering how to become famous on Instagram?</p>
<p>Countless people today are looking for guides on how they can become an Instagram influencer overnight or attract millions of followers to their profile. It makes sense.</p>
<p>Instagram is one of the most popular social media sharing platforms in the world, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253577/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">more than 1 billion monthly active users</a>. In an age where customers are glued to their smartphones, Instagram offers a way to connect, engage, and explore that today&#8217;s consumers love.</p>
<p>However, while there are plenty of opportunities to achieve #InstaFame these days &#8211; it&#8217;s not easy.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t become Instagram famous in an instant, even if they have some of the best content the industry has ever seen. If you want to achieve an incredible following on Instagram, and improve your chances of long-term success, then you&#8217;re going to need a strategy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can help with that.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s your guide on how to become Instagram famous.</p>
<h2>The Ingredients of Instagram Fame</h2>
<p>Before you can start on your path to become an Instagram influencer, or achieve your first taste of Instagram fame, you&#8217;re going to need to get the basics in place.</p>
<p>Learning how to become famous on Instagram means knowing how to use the platform to your advantage. That means that you&#8217;re going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li>An excellent Instagram profile: Make sure that you have a business profile, as this will allow you to track the performance of your post via Instagram Insights.</li>
<li>The right bio: Fill out your Instagram profile with information that will highlight your credibility. An engaging bio that tells your story, a <a href="https://jumpermedia.co/instagram-profile-picture-tips-and-ideas/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">beautiful profile picture</a> and a compelling username are all crucial.</li>
<li>The right content strategy: Promoting an Instagram profile with sub-standard content is a total waste of time. Make sure you know how to use your camera, and that you know what kind of content to post.</li>
<li>Consistency: Decide how many posts you&#8217;re going to be publishing each day or week. Most Instagram influencers will publish material at least once per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various other ingredients for Instagram success that you&#8217;ll need to consider too, such as a passion for a specific niche, the right Instagram marketing tools, and more. Having a plan in place will ensure that you don&#8217;t veer off in the wrong direction on your quest for fame.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got the basics of your Instagram profile right, you can move onto the following steps.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Do Your Research</h2>
<p>Just like any goal in life, it&#8217;s important to have plenty of information before you get started.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to Instagram, spend some time <a href="https://www.marketingdonut.co.uk/social-media/instagram/six-things-you-need-to-know-about-instagram" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">learning everything there is to know</a> about the app, the algorithm used for sorting posts, and the rules you&#8217;ll need to follow with your posts. There are also some additional types of homework you&#8217;ll need to do to make sure you&#8217;re fully informed. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of competitors and idols do you have in your space? Are there people on Instagram that you aspire to be like? How can you mimic them without losing your unique essence? What about competitors? Is there anything you can do to make yourself stand out in the market?</li>
<li>Which sort of niche do you want to be in? What are you passionate about? As an Instagram influencer or Instagram-focused brand, you&#8217;ll want to develop a thought leadership position in your space. It makes sense to choose something that you&#8217;re genuinely interested in.</li>
<li>Who do you want to connect with? What kind of audience are you going to be reaching out to with your posts? Based on what you know about your competitors and idols, what are those consumers interested in? What do they like and dislike?</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, when it comes to learning how to become Instagram famous, knowledge is power. The more you can learn about your industry, competition, target audience, and niche; the more nuanced your plan will become. Look at how @Lipstickfever, Emily Roberts has built her position of Instagram fame by choosing a very specific niche (lipstick and makeup), got to know her audience, and looked for ways to stand out with unique content.</p>
<div id="attachment_831" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-831" class="wp-image-831 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@lipstickfever-emily-roberts-instagram-1024x754.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="754" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@lipstickfever-emily-roberts-instagram-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@lipstickfever-emily-roberts-instagram-300x221.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@lipstickfever-emily-roberts-instagram-768x566.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@lipstickfever-emily-roberts-instagram.jpg 1624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-831" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Emily Roberts of @lipstickfever.</p></div>
<h2>Step 2: Create Your Image</h2>
<p>With your research in hand, you&#8217;ll be able to start creating your Instagram aesthetic.</p>
<p>Instagram is a highly visual platform, which means that the appearance of your profile, content, and everything you share is crucial. Going back to the example we shared above; you&#8217;ll notice <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thelipstickfever/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">that Emily Roberts</a> is very effective at maintaining a specific aesthetic with custom Instagram highlight covers, and a well-spaced, emoji-rich bio:</p>
<p>Establishing a consistent image will make it easier for your followers to recognize you and begin building an affinity with your personal brand. Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your Instagram grid: Make sure that your audience sees something truly phenomenal whenever they click onto your Instagram profile, with a well-organized grid.</li>
<li>Choose a color scheme: Decide which colors you want to focus on in your content and maintain that theme throughout your posts.</li>
<li>Pick your favorite filters: Rather than constantly jumping between filters, select a handful that suits your material best.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Plan Some Amazing Content</h2>
<p>Having a great profile and an Instagram aesthetic is great, but you won&#8217;t discover how to become famous on Instagram until you start sharing valuable content. If you plan to become an Instagram influencer, then the kind of content you share will be crucial. After all, you&#8217;re convincing people that you should be paid to feature them on your posts.</p>
<p>As Instagram becomes increasingly popular, it&#8217;s growing even more difficult for users to stand out on the platform. To get ahead of the game, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the best camera you&#8217;ve got, and practice your photography skills</li>
<li>Take videos and photos during the day when you have the best natural light</li>
<li>Think carefully about how you can entertain your audience with captions</li>
<li>Invest in <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/tools-for-perfect-instagram-photos/" data-wpel-link="internal">photo editing tools</a> like VSCO and Snapseed</li>
<li>Deliver value: Find out what your audience wants to see and share it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, you don&#8217;t just have to stick to photos when you&#8217;re posting on Instagram either. Carousels and videos are an excellent way to change things up and make a deeper connection with your audience. Additionally, Instagram Stories are an amazing way to highlight the authentic nature of your brand with behind-the-scenes insights.</p>
<div id="attachment_834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-834" class="wp-image-834 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kim-kardashian-instagram-1024x753.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian is inspiration to become Instagram famous " width="1024" height="753" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kim-kardashian-instagram-1024x753.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kim-kardashian-instagram-300x221.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kim-kardashian-instagram-768x565.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/kim-kardashian-instagram.jpg 1624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-834" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Kim Kardashian of @kimkardashian and @kkwbeauty.</p></div>
<h2>Step 4: Remain Authentic and Listen to your Audience</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz_GB7sAdGT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Nicole Loher</a> &#8211; a huge Instagram influencer in the health and fitness space &#8211; if you really want to achieve Instagram fame, then you need to connect with your followers. That means not just posting endless content without listening to their feedback. Instead, you need to figure out what your people want from you and deliver genuine value for them.</p>
<p>When it comes to figuring out how to become Instagram famous, a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that they can just post whatever they want. However, the truth is that you need to prove to your audience that they&#8217;re not wasting their time by following you. Find out what kind of content your followers respond to best and adapt your profile to suit the needs of the people you want to reach.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, remember that even if you start to achieve success as an Instagram influencer, your profile shouldn&#8217;t become all about selling. Rather than advocating for any brand to make money, make sure you only work with people and companies that match your brand and reflect your values. Nicole Loher would never share a post that promotes unhealthy food because that would go against her identity as a health and fitness influencer and confuse her target audience.</p>
<div id="attachment_835" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-835" class="wp-image-835 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-03-at-12.51.42-PM-1024x752.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="752" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-03-at-12.51.42-PM-1024x752.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-03-at-12.51.42-PM-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-03-at-12.51.42-PM-768x564.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-03-at-12.51.42-PM.jpg 1628w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-835" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Nicole Loher of @nicoleloher.</p></div>
<h2>Step 5: Hack your Hashtag Strategy</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to write an article on how to become famous on Instagram without mentioning hashtags. While many of the most famous people on Instagram rarely use hashtags on their posts today, you can bet that they started by tagging everything they published. That&#8217;s because hashtags are the tools that will help people to find your profile on Instagram.</p>
<p>Hashtags will drive more eyeballs to your content, meaning that you can begin to engage more potential followers. The good news for people who struggle with hashtags is that there are plenty of tools out there that can help you. For instance, <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji.AI</a> uses machine learning to track down the most compelling niche tags for your industry. Remember, the key to success with hashtags is using the right combination. You&#8217;re going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trending hashtags: Things like #TBT and #InstaGood that are common among Instagram influencers and everyday users alike.</li>
<li>Niche tags: The specific location-based and industry-focused hashtags that will attract the attention of the right audience members for you.</li>
<li>Brand or unique hashtags: Your tags that are created to help you cultivate #Curated posts and become #InstaFamous</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that having your own hashtag will help you to appear more professional and credible in your industry too. For instance, Joe Wicks, @TheBodyCoach frequently uses tags like #BodyCoachSchools and #LeanIn15 to advertise his new diet and health plans.</p>
<div id="attachment_836" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-836" class="wp-image-836 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@thebodycoach-instagram-1024x656.jpg" alt="Use branded hashtags to become Instagram famous." width="1024" height="656" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@thebodycoach-instagram-1024x656.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@thebodycoach-instagram-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@thebodycoach-instagram-768x492.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/@thebodycoach-instagram.jpg 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-836" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Joe Wicks of @thebodycoach.</p></div>
<h2>Step 6: Work with Another Instagram Influencer</h2>
<p>Think back to your school days. The chances are that if you wanted to become popular in a particular class, the first thing you needed to do is make friends with the people who already had a lot of influence in that space. The same rules apply to Instagram fame.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re sick of waiting around for people to find you and discover how amazing your content is, the best thing you can do is piggyback on someone else&#8217;s influence. Working with an Instagram influencer that already has an impact in your space is a great way to improve your chances of attracting new followers. Make a list of all the potential micro-influencers that might be willing to help you out, then reach out to them.</p>
<p>Remember, it may take a while to build the right connection with influencers so that they&#8217;ll want to work with you. However, commenting on their posts and sending direct messages should be a good start. If the influencers you choose see your profile and recognize that you&#8217;re relevant to their niche, they may get back in touch.</p>
<h2>Step 7: Invest in Constant Engagement</h2>
<p>Finally, #Fame as we know it has changed over the years. People don&#8217;t want to follow untouchable celebrities that they know nothing about anymore. Instead, they want to develop genuine connections with the people behind the profiles. Anyone learning how to become Instagram famous needs to figure out how they can help their follower base gets to know them better through regular engagement.</p>
<p>Consider telling anecdotes and stories in your Instagram captions that highlight your unique personality. Be witty and playful in your Instagram Stories, and don&#8217;t be afraid to experiment with gifs and emojis. Remember to ask your followers questions and respond to their comments too. The more you show that you value your community, the more they&#8217;ll reward you. Some of the other ways you can engage with your tribe include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting polls and questions in your Instagram stories to learn more about your followers.</li>
<li>Running competitions and contests that allow you to gather and share user-generated content.</li>
<li>Re-gramming and liking content shared by your target audience.</li>
<li>Asking users to double-tap and like your pictures when they feel a connection to what you share.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram models. Those familiar with the app have undoubtedly stumbled across this demographic. In fact, being the saturated market that they are, these profiles are near impossible to avoid.</p>
<p>You know the kind: the often picture-perfect, glamorous, strikingly beautiful faces of the platform. These profiles harness thousands of followers by the month, with a lifestyle and aesthetic akin to that of a Pinterest board.</p>
<h2>So What is This &#8220;Instagram Models&#8221; Trend?</h2>
<p>Instagram models are exactly as their title describes them: attractive figures who upload perfectly-posed photos on Instagram, often advertising a place, product, or service.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-423 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-model-hashtag.jpg" alt="Instagram - &quot;#model&quot; hashtag" width="1000" height="618" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-model-hashtag.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-model-hashtag-300x185.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-model-hashtag-768x475.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>They&#8217;ve built themselves a large, active online presence, backed by a large sum of followers. Success in this digital <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-careers/" data-wpel-link="internal">career</a> is immediately correlated to the numbers gained in their audience count. Like real-life models, their content often caters to a certain niche, such as fitness or high-fashion.</p>
<p>In comparison to traditional industry models, an Instagram model&#8217;s life is relatively more accessible. Given that anyone can create an Instagram account, anyone who does has the potential of joining the &#8220;Instagram models&#8221; trend.</p>
<p>But how exactly does this lifestyle pay?</p>
<h2>Making Money as an Instagram Model</h2>
<p>An Instagram model&#8217;s life profits from two main income sources: product brand deals and travel brand deals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into how either works, and how one acquires them.</p>
<h3>Product Brand Deals</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve likely come across a post from an attractive influencer, raving about their favourite brand of makeup or having discovered a detox tea that &#8220;really works!&#8221;</p>
<p>Chances are, these photos are sponsored by the original company. Once an Instagram model gains enough traction on the platform, sporting an impressive sum of followers; brands in their niche will see their audience as a lucrative marketing opportunity.</p>
<div id="attachment_421" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-421" class="size-full wp-image-421" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-sherlockdiary.jpg" alt="sherlockdiary - Instagram model's life" width="1000" height="733" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-sherlockdiary.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-sherlockdiary-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-sherlockdiary-768x563.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-421" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of sherlockdiary (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>They pay the model top dollar to have their products mentioned or reviewed. This creates a win-win scenario: the model gets acknowledged by the company&#8217;s audience base, and the brand gets their stuff advertised to thousands of potential consumers.</p>
<p>This practice has been termed &#8220;influencer marketing&#8221;, and extends beyond the realm of models. Generally, anyone with a high follower count can acquire a brand deal and turn a profit on both ends.</p>
<h3><strong>Travel Brand Deals</strong></h3>
<p>Other than tangible, physical products, some brands may even pay a model (or influencer!) to visit a certain destination. The model is then paid to snap captivating pictures of their adventures, highlighting the most enticing aspects of the location.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-424 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-traveller.jpg" alt="Social media influencer travel photo" width="1049" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-traveller.jpg 1049w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-traveller-300x143.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-traveller-768x366.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-traveller-1024x488.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1049px) 100vw, 1049px" /></p>
<p>These types of posts are commonplace on the platform. They often portray the Instagram model&#8217;s life as one full of excitement and experience; as the person uploads shot-after-shot of cocktails on the beach, visits at the Eiffel Tower, and bikini-clad selfies in striking blue waves.</p>
<p>Like product deals, an Instagram model requires a substantial following (and thus, higher consumer influence) to get paid for their travels. However, this option has the added perk of getting to experience amazing places and cultures around the globe.</p>
<h2>The Truth Behind the Glamour</h2>
<p>As alluring as an Instagram model&#8217;s life may seem, we often forget that these are just ordinary people, working any other full-time job.</p>
<p>Many are quick to assume that Instagram models live a 24/7 high-lifestyle, when much of the &#8220;perfection&#8221; is fabricated or staged.</p>
<p>In late 2015, Instagram model Rebecca Pearson wrote a <em>Telegraph </em>article exposing the truth behind her &#8220;glamorous&#8221; shots. The young up-and-coming influencer promotes herself as an athletic, healthy-eating traveller with a penchant for reading Dostoevsky.</p>
<div id="attachment_417" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-417" class="size-full wp-image-417" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-model-1rebeccapearson-instagram-models-life.jpg" alt="1rebeccapearson - Instagram model" width="1000" height="735" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-model-1rebeccapearson-instagram-models-life.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-model-1rebeccapearson-instagram-models-life-300x221.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-model-1rebeccapearson-instagram-models-life-768x564.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-417" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of 1rebeccapearson (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>While these characteristics may very well be true, her online photos serve as an exaggerated, oftentimes fabricated, version of this life, as she would later explain.</p>
<p>The whole ordeal took an ultimate toll on Pearson. She revealed that most photos take a draining number of takes to get the &#8220;ideal&#8221; shot, that most &#8220;spontaneity&#8221; is likely staged, and that the never-ending toil of staying relevant leads to general exhaustion and resentment for the game.</p>
<p>Like with any other job, an Instagram model&#8217;s life involves much hard work. However, these guys get the added pressure of joining the &#8220;likes&#8221; race; in an attempt to gain clients&#8217; attention and stay ahead of the competition.</p>
<h2>Tips for Becoming a Successful Instagram Model</h2>
<p>Think this line of work is cut out for you? Those ready to get their social media savviness on can use the following tips to grow a large, engaged following as an Instagram model.</p>
<h3>Define Your Unique Niche and Style</h3>
<p>Your first step is to figure out what community you&#8217;ll be catering to. Is it fitness? Travel? Fashion and beauty?</p>
<p>The most successful Instagram stars, models or otherwise, know their niche and market it well. This helps you in determining the brands you&#8217;ll partner up with in the future, and helps set clear-cut goals for your content.</p>
<div id="attachment_422" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-422" class="size-full wp-image-422" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-allegrashaw-define-your-style.jpg" alt="Instagram models trend - creating a visual theme for your feed" width="1000" height="853" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-allegrashaw-define-your-style.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-allegrashaw-define-your-style-300x256.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-trend-allegrashaw-define-your-style-768x655.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-422" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of allegrashaw (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>By hopping on the Instagram models trend, you&#8217;re also need what any traditional model has: an impressive, eye-catching portfolio.</p>
<p>Your profile feed serves this very function. By having a defined, unique style across your photos, you&#8217;ll create a striking portfolio that&#8217;s sure to catch the attention of brands and talent scouts across the platform.</p>
<h3>Ensure High Quality Photographs</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re less likely to find work as a regular model without a folder of well-taken photographs; and Instagram is no different.</p>
<p>In contrast to other well-known social media beasts, such as Facebook, Youtube, or Twitter &#8211; Instagram&#8217;s prime focus is on quality images and videos. Therefore, to find success in this realm, you&#8217;ve got to bring your best visual content forward.</p>
<div id="attachment_418" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-418" class="size-full wp-image-418" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-gizemnsevinc-high-quality-photos.jpg" alt="gizemnsevinc - Instagram model's life" width="1000" height="733" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-gizemnsevinc-high-quality-photos.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-gizemnsevinc-high-quality-photos-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-gizemnsevinc-high-quality-photos-768x563.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-418" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of gizemnsevinc (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>This is doubly true for models, who build careers on beautifully-taken photographs of themselves. Ensure your feed is comprised of well-lit, crisp and clear, well-compositioned pictures of you and your ventures; which successfully market your photogenic looks <em>and </em>the theme of the photo.</p>
<p>Of course, it never hurts to take a selfie every once in a while &#8211; this creates a likeable feeling of authenticity among your followers.</p>
<h3>Interact with the Instagram Model Community</h3>
<p>While content is key on Instagram, it&#8217;s still a social media platform, after all.</p>
<p>Take the time to reach out to others in your field, whether it&#8217;s to leave a simple like, or even an appreciative comment or two. This not only engages you with the community, but establishes an active, relevant presence among your target audience.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-416 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-likes-smartphone-screen.jpg" alt="Smartphone screen Instagram likes" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-likes-smartphone-screen.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-likes-smartphone-screen-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-likes-smartphone-screen-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A common practice among influencers (or brands) is to leave comments on the profiles of their competitors. Though the original poster may not always reply, this gives you visibility among those who follow them. Capture enough attention, and you&#8217;ll likely gain a few new fans from <em>their </em>existing audience.</p>
<p>In time, you may make a handful of new friends or business connections, along with a steady increase in followers.</p>
<div id="attachment_419" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-419" class="size-full wp-image-419" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-allegreshaw-respond-to-comments.jpg" alt="allegreshaw - Instagram model" width="1000" height="734" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-allegreshaw-respond-to-comments.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-allegreshaw-respond-to-comments-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-models-life-allegreshaw-respond-to-comments-768x564.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-419" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of allegreshaw (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Of course, never neglect your <em>own </em>audience. Take time to leave likes or reply to the comments they leave you &#8211; this makes them feel valued, and boosts their loyalty as a result.</p>
<h3>Collaborate With Other Instagram Models or Photographers</h3>
<p>For faster growth, try teaming up with other up-and-coming figures in your industry.</p>
<p>By collaborating with users of bigger followings, you&#8217;re given the opportunity to tap into their audience &#8211; meaning greater engagement for your content. This is why it&#8217;s important to stay engaged with competitors in your industry; you never know when a friendly greeting could result in a full-blown partnership down the line.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-414 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/female-friends-alcoholic-beverage-laughing-smiling.jpg" alt="Female friends laughing holding beverage" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/female-friends-alcoholic-beverage-laughing-smiling.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/female-friends-alcoholic-beverage-laughing-smiling-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/female-friends-alcoholic-beverage-laughing-smiling-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Collaborating with other models can be as simple as taking a selfie together, or by doing a joint promotion, or by arranging interviews. Working with photographers may require shelling out a bit of cash for their services &#8211; or you can request for a trade-for-print exchange.</p>
<h3>Have a Consistent Schedule</h3>
<p>As we mentioned, being a full-time Instagram model means you&#8217;ll be working a full-time job, with the added bonus of constant competition.</p>
<p>This means being on top of your game, consistently. You can&#8217;t expect an increasing rise in followers without maintaining relevance, which can only be achieved through regularly uploading content.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-413 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/calendar-person-holding-writing-planner.jpg" alt="Person holding calendar" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/calendar-person-holding-writing-planner.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/calendar-person-holding-writing-planner-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/calendar-person-holding-writing-planner-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>By ensuring weekly (or in some cases, daily) posts, you remain active among fans and display a strong work ethic towards brands and potential clients.</p>
<p>An easy way of <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/how-often-should-you-post-on-instagram-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">keeping your feed updated</a> on a steady, frequent basis is to use an Instagram scheduler. One of the best, free tools available for this is Later, a marketing platform that not only helps you schedule your posts, but allows you to visually plan them, too.</p>
<div id="attachment_174" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174" class="size-full wp-image-174" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling.png" alt="Instagram post scheduling with Later" width="1000" height="437" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling-300x131.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling-768x336.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-174" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>
<p>Their user-friendly, drag-and-drop interface makes the app incredibly convenient to use, with team management and analytics features to boot.</p>
<h3>Ensure Consistent Growth</h3>
<p>Finding success on the platform is an uphill climb, and you&#8217;ve got to keep improving yourself each time.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t evolving for the better, you&#8217;re unlikely to witness the growth you&#8217;re after. Know your best times to post (Instagram Insights can help greatly with this), discover what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and when necessary &#8211; listen to your audience.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-343 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-marketing-how-to-market-on-instagram-business-analytics.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Audience" width="440" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-marketing-how-to-market-on-instagram-business-analytics.png 440w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/instagram-marketing-how-to-market-on-instagram-business-analytics-165x300.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>While content is undoubtedly a top priority on this platform, so is your progress as an influencer. The app is full of Instagram models trying to make it, so be sure you&#8217;re constantly finding ways to stand out.</p>
