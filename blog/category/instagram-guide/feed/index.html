								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you tried Linktree yet? Wondering if it&#8217;s a safe tool to use for your Instagram accounts? There are some things that you need to know about this tool before you take the plunge.</p>
<p>In this Linktree review, I&#8217;ll share my insights; how it works, the benefits, pros and cons, and if it&#8217;s something we recommend. If you were thinking about trying Linktree, take a minute to read this article first.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>What is Linktree?</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1683 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreelogo.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="110" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreelogo.jpg 317w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreelogo-300x104.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /></p>
<p>Linktree is a tool that is designed to enhance your Instagram bio links. You can use it to design a kind of landing page for your Instagram links.</p>
<p>As we know, Instagram only allows one hyperlink in your bio. That can be quite limiting for marketers who have multiple product pages. That&#8217;s the problem Linktree tries to solve.¬†Overall, the concept is rather simple.</p>
<h2>What You Need to Know About Linktree</h2>
<p>What Linktree does is basically create a mobile-optimized page that you can personalize with links, backgrounds, colors, and custom text. Think of it as a mini-website builder, with a wide range of customization options. It&#8217;s not a bot, and it won&#8217;t grow your audience. It&#8217;s more like an optimization tool.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the PRO version adds even more features, such as the ability to edit the header of your page, email sign-up integration, remove the Linktree logo, complete customization, add thumbnails, and much more. The free version is rather limited.</p>
<p>The good news is there are no link-limits on the Free account. You can add as many as you want.</p>
<h2>A Quick Linktree Review</h2>
<p>In a rush? Here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Linktree is a decent tool for adding more links to your Instagram bio, but when compared to other tools, we feel like it doesn&#8217;t have nearly as many features.</p>
<p>At the moment, we don&#8217;t recommend Linktree. However, we do recommend an alternative tool called Bio.fm. It does basically the same thing as Linktree but with more features and design options.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also free, <a href="https://bio.fm/signup" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">check it out.¬†</a></p>
<h3>How Much Does It Cost?</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1680 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreeprices.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="274" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreeprices.jpg 898w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreeprices-300x137.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreeprices-768x351.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Right now, the tool has two memberships: Free, and PRO. The Free version is free forever but limited in a number of ways.</p>
<p>The PRO version grants access to all features and customization options, it costs $6 a month. At least, it&#8217;s a budget-friendly way to optimize the appearance of links in your Instagram bio.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Here are some features you should know about.</p>
<h4>Choose a Theme</h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-1682 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/themes.jpg" alt="" width="603" height="362" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/themes.jpg 721w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/themes-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></p>
<p>The tool has 10 preset themes with color configurations.</p>
<p>PRO users can create their own custom color profiles. In the custom profile section, you can change the background, link color, button style, and gradients. Most people will use the preset themes because those are all that&#8217;s available to free members.</p>
<p>Another nice feature is the ability to see a live preview of your theme selection working with your links, making it easier to choose a theme that best matches your brand.</p>
<h4>Track Views and Clicks</h4>
<p>For the data geeks, Linktree has an option to track views and clicks. The data is organized into a neat chart, making it easy to compare views and clicks. There&#8217;s also a click-through ratio. I like the analytics, I think it&#8217;s quite useful.</p>
<h4>Add Pictures and GIFS for Backgrounds</h4>
<p>Although this feature is exclusive to the PRO membership, it&#8217;s worth talking about. Users can use their own custom pictures as a background, as well as GIFS. The tool also supplies you with over 500,000 royalty-free images to use.</p>
<h4>Email List Integration</h4>
<p>Another PRO feature is email integration. With this feature users can add their sign-up forms directly to their Linktree page, so visitors can easily register. It makes building a list much easier. The only problem is this feature only works with Mailchimp at the moment.</p>
<h4>Rearrange and Manage Links</h4>
<p>The tool makes it really easy to rearrange and edit links. To move a link, simply drag and drop it to the desired location. Likewise, to edit, simply click the edit icon and you can change the title and website destination in a couple of clicks. Very cool.</p>
<h2>Is Linktree Banned from Instagram?</h2>
<p>There have been some rumors circulating that Linktree has been banned from Instagram. It looks like Instagram is cracking down on these kinds of tools (for reasons we&#8217;ll mention below) but, at the moment, Linktree is not banned from Instagram.</p>
<h2>Linktree Pros</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we liked about this tool.</p>
<h3>Easy to Use and Simple üëç</h3>
<p>Create an account in seconds, claim your custom Linktree, and start adding lists. It really only takes a few minutes to build a simple page. The preset templates are usually sufficient for basic links.</p>
<h3>Free Forever Account üëç</h3>
<p>Another thing I really liked is the option to use the free account, forever. There are limitations, of course, but it provides most of the basic features.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great for small Instagram accounts. Granted, the paid version is also incredibly budget-friendly, it only costs $6 a month. That&#8217;s cheaper than Netflix!</p>
<h3>Advertise Multiple Offers in One Place üëç</h3>
<p>Now, this is probably the main reason people use Linktree. It gives users the option to advertise multiple offers, on separate links, instead of swapping out the Instagram bio link over and over. Most marketers are quite happy with this feature and it works quite well.</p>
<h3>High Level of Customization üëç</h3>
<p>While the basic free membership has a decent level of customization, the Pro membership adds a whole new level.</p>
<p>You can customize almost every aspect of the page, and include basically whatever content you want, as long as their within the guidelines. Not to mention GIFS and button animations!</p>
<h3>The Company Uses Their Own Tool üëç</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1681" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/officiallinktreepage.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="335" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/officiallinktreepage.jpg 951w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/officiallinktreepage-300x167.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/officiallinktreepage-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>While this not a major highlight, it&#8217;s worth talking about. It&#8217;s always nice to see a company that actually uses their own tools.</p>
<p>Linktree uses their own service on its own Instagram profile, which has over 22.9K followers. And they haven&#8217;t been banned. That&#8217;s a good sign.</p>
<h2>Linktree Cons</h2>
<p>But there are some downsides, too.</p>
<h3>Performance Issues üëé</h3>
<p>Since these mini-web pages are hosted on the company&#8217;s servers, it requires a lot of resources to keep all the pages up at all times. There are lots of people complaining online about the server performance, claiming their link-pages won&#8217;t load, or deliver an error.</p>
<p>To be fair, the company does work hard to improve software performance, and they&#8217;re also relatively active on social media. But it&#8217;s still worth mentioning that you might encounter some performance issues.</p>
<h3>Instagram Is Cracking Down on Bio-Link Tools üëé</h3>
<p>First things first, although these tools aren&#8217;t exactly against Instagram&#8217;s policies, they create a kind of loophole to bypass Instagram rules.</p>
<p>And a lot of people are taking advantage of that loophole. For example, some people use Linktree to redirect people to inappropriate websites.</p>
<p>A while back, Instagram started marking all Linktree links as spam.¬†When you would try to load one of the links through Instagram, it would say the links are not allowed. Naturally, a lot of Linktree members weren&#8217;t happy about it.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1616 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreetwitternotice.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="255" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreetwitternotice.jpg 790w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreetwitternotice-300x128.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/linktreetwitternotice-768x327.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>The company did send out <a href="https://twitter.com/linktree_/status/1017766329514799110?lang=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">a notice on Twitter</a> to let people know they&#8217;re working to resolve the issue. They seem to be pretty active on social media.</p>
<p>It seems like everything is working once again, but I feel like it&#8217;s just a matter of time before Instagram blocks the links again. It wouldn&#8217;t be great if you paid for a tool that got banned.</p>
<h3>Your Website Conversion Rate Suffers¬†üëé</h3>
<p>When it comes to marketing online, you have to realize people are rather impatient. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to view your offer, in as few clicks as possible.</p>
<p>Every extra click is like an extra step and most people will close the page after one or two clicks. If they can&#8217;t get it now, they don&#8217;t want it.</p>
<p>So what Linktree does is basically create an extra gap between your audience and your website. Instead of linking directly to your website on your Instagram bio (link most brands do) you send people to your Linktree page.</p>
<p>From there, they have to click again to visit your website. Not to mention this also has a negative impact on your website&#8217;s search engine optimization.</p>
<h2>Is There a Better Alternative?</h2>
<p>While I wouldn&#8217;t say Linktree is a bad tool, it&#8217;s not one of our recommended tools at the moment. The reason for that is because we know of a much better tool that accomplishes the same goal with even more features. What I&#8217;m talking about is <strong>Bio.fm</strong>.</p>
<p>P.S. wondering what other Instagram tools we recommend? <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/best-tools-for-instagram-managers-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal">Take a look at this list.¬†</a></p>
<h3>What is Bio.fm?</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-1684 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/biofmlogo.jpg" alt="" width="451" height="246" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/biofmlogo.jpg 634w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/biofmlogo-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></p>
<p>Bio.fm is probably one of the coolest Instagram bio-link tools I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of testing out.</p>
<p>It also makes a mini-web page for your links but instead of only supporting text-buttons, Bio.fm supports all kinds of apps, including YouTube videos, Spotify, Soundcloud, and much more.</p>
<p>One of the features I liked most about Bio.fm is the grid-view. You can customize the grid layout or remove it and display one featured block.</p>
<p>Either way, the way it is worth checking out, and I feel like it offers more features than Linktree. The price is about the same as Linktree.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re looking for a good tool to handle your Instagram bio links, I highly recommend Bio.fm. Linktree is worth a look too, but I feel like it doesn&#8217;t have nearly as many features as Bio.fm.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Linktree review. Hopefully, now you understand how the tool works and you&#8217;re aware of a better alternative tool.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the visual platform it is, we all want our Instagram photos to look their best. This involves adding filters, color boosts, and at times, Photoshop effects, to achieve the ideal image we&#8217;re after. While our blog has covered <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-photos/" data-wpel-link="internal">plenty of these subjects already,</a> a topic we&#8217;ve yet to touch on is the technique of cropping photos for Instagram.</p>
<p>The process is the first thing that pops up when uploading a new photo. Cropping a photo determines its focal points, thus crafting a tighter story or message in its visuals. It&#8217;s a simple technique, yet offers that quick, subtle boost in aesthetic quality.</p>
<h2>Why Crop Your Photos? Composition Tips for Instagram</h2>
<p><strong>Good¬†</strong>photography is crafted through a range of factors; these including the right lighting, angle, background, and color pallette. However, above all else, a quality photo starts with proper¬†<strong>composition.</strong></p>
<p>This entails how the elements in your photo are arranged to convey your message. An image with good composition will successfully guide its viewer&#8217;s eye towards the photo&#8217;s most important aspects &#8211; oftentimes in a specific order.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1638 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-composition.png" alt="Instagram - composition" width="425" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-composition.png 425w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-composition-159x300.png 159w" sizes="(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px" /></p>
<p>Good composition allows you to properly tell your story. It effectively makes your image interesting, regardless of how &#8220;plain&#8221; or &#8220;bland&#8221; your environment or subjects may be.</p>
<p>This is where cropping can play a huge role; by snipping away unimportant aspects of your image, you&#8217;re giving your photo a tighter focus &#8211; framing only the most intriguing details.</p>
<p>Below, we discuss how cropping your photos for Instagram can instantly give them that extra¬†<em>oomph¬†</em>&#8211; creating a more professional, cohesive feed overall.</p>
<h3>The Rule of Thirds</h3>
<p>Arguably the most common guideline used by photographers, the &#8220;Rule of Thirds&#8221; refers to a method of composition used to balance and space out your image; while still maintaining visual interest.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1642 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-composition-rule-of-thirds.jpg" alt="Instagram composition - Rule of Thirds" width="813" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-composition-rule-of-thirds.jpg 813w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-composition-rule-of-thirds-300x296.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-composition-rule-of-thirds-768x758.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-composition-rule-of-thirds-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /></p>
<p>This technique involves imagining your photo divided into a grid of nine equal parts. Generally, your main subject takes up one-third or two-thirds of the photo &#8211; either horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>While some may choose to place their most important elements at the center of the image, an off-center composition generally creates a more interesting, natural look.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1640" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-rule-of-thirds.jpg" alt="How to crop photos - the Rule of Thirds" width="799" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-rule-of-thirds.jpg 799w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-rule-of-thirds-150x150.jpg 150w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-rule-of-thirds-300x300.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-rule-of-thirds-768x771.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-rule-of-thirds-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /></p>
<p>Having your subject placed in the far-left or far-right corners of your image also lets you play around with the remaining negative space. The image above, for example, places the house in the bottom-left corner of the photo, taking up a vertical one-third of the &#8220;grid.&#8221; The rest (two-thirds) of the photo can then highlight the surrounding scenery, offering plenty of interesting colors, lines, and textures for the eye to explore.</p>
<p>Having the &#8220;Rule of Thirds&#8221; while cropping your photo can thus make for a more focused, balanced image. While the &#8220;rules&#8221; above are commonplace, you can get as creative as you want with this; and experiment with placing subjects within or across various squares or intersections on the &#8220;grid&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Stick to Details</h3>
<p>Another benefit to cropping your photo on Instagram is the ability to highlight specific details.</p>
<p>You may have taken a photo with unnecessary elements distracting from your main subject. Instead of leaving them in the frame &#8211; making your photo look less &#8220;professional&#8221; &#8211; you can opt to crop them out.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1639" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-show-details.jpg" alt="Cropping photos - showing more detail" width="1000" height="650" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-show-details.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-show-details-300x195.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-instagram-show-details-768x499.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This makes for a tighter shot, more accurately conveying your message. This helps your viewer concentrate on only the most important details.</p>
<p>Zooming in and cropping your photo also lets you fill up your frame, helping your subject(s) stand out in Instagram&#8217;s small, square aspect ratios.</p>
<h3>Have It Centered</h3>
<p>Though the &#8220;Rule of Thirds&#8221; encourages keeping your subject off-center, sometimes it&#8217;s fine to break the rules.</p>
<p>In fact, it may even boost your image. Centered framing works best with strong, focused subjects. If they can stand on their own and grab the viewer&#8217;s attention, they may work best at the center of your &#8220;grid&#8221;.</p>

<p>Emil Parkarklis of iPhone Photography School <a href="https://iphonephotographyschool.com/square-composition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">does just this</a> with the photo above. The silhouettes of both the window and person next to it pop right out of the frame, and work well as central elements.</p>
<p>This composition also optimizes Instagram&#8217;s squared framing, as there&#8217;s little extra space around your subject to divert your viewer&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3>Keep Things Symmetrical</h3>
<p>Another popular technique that breaks the &#8220;Rule of Thirds&#8221; is the use of visual symmetry.</p>
<p>When applied well, a symmetry can enhance the visual look of a photograph; and bring attention to an otherwise &#8220;bland&#8221; or uninteresting subject. It adds a sense of harmony to your image, keeping things balanced and proportionate.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1634" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry.jpg" alt="How to crop photos - symmetry" width="823" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry.jpg 823w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry-300x292.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry-768x748.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" /></p>
<p>However, as the &#8220;Rule of Thirds&#8221; dictates, an overuse of symmetry can get boring pretty quick. Not all environments or subjects need geometric balance &#8211; so it&#8217;s nice to add a bit of interest here and there.</p>
<p>Photographers often keep the main focus of their image symmetrical, while adding a few dynamic elements to keep things engaging. The photo below, for example, displays a symmetrical road in the middle of the image. The upper, horizontal two-thirds, however, display varying visual details of cars, buildings, and the color gradient of the sunset.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1637 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry.jpg" alt="Instagram photography tips - symmetry" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry.jpg 640w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-symmetry-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>These elements keeps things aesthetically interesting, while the image of the road below maintains a sense of balance.</p>
<p>When cropping your photos on Instagram, you can adjust an otherwise disproportionate image to create a sense of Wes Anderson-style symmetry.</p>
<h3>Less is More&#8230; But Make it Pop!</h3>
<p>A helpful <a href="https://kutovakika.com/blog/3-photo-composition-tips-for-better-storytelling-on-instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">piece of advice</a> from the photographer Kika of her self-named blog, Kutova Kika; is to keep things sweet and simple when capturing that perfect image.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tempting to include all the interesting details observed through your lens, though multiple elements at once can leave your image unnecessarily complicated and unfocused.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on the one standout detail that truly makes the image for you. Make it the prime attraction of your photo; all other details are simply there to <em>enhance¬†</em>rather than detract away from your subject.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1631" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-less-is-more.jpg" alt="How to crop photos - Less is more" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-less-is-more.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-less-is-more-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-less-is-more-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>You can crop an otherwise &#8220;busy&#8221; photo to achieve this, cutting out any unnecessary, distracting elements.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s important to make your subject discernible from its surroundings. Play around with lighting and colors to really make them &#8220;pop&#8221; from the frame.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1636" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-make-image-pop-girl-on-chair-black-balloon.jpg" alt="Instagram photography tips - making your image pop" width="943" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-make-image-pop-girl-on-chair-black-balloon.jpg 943w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-make-image-pop-girl-on-chair-black-balloon-300x255.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-crop-photos-for-instagram-make-image-pop-girl-on-chair-black-balloon-768x652.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px" /></p>
<p>Photographers often contrast hues and color palettes between the subject and their environment to create a striking, dramatic effect.</p>
<h2>Default Aspect Ratios on Instagram</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered photo composition, let&#8217;s take a look at the three main aspect ratios Instagram provides its images.</p>
<p>The &#8220;aspect ratio&#8221; of an Instagram photo refers to its width in relation to its height. Identified by a ratio, the first number refers to the image width, while the second refers to its height (e.g. 4:5 for portrait image aspect ratios).</p>
<p>The size of an image, on the other hand, is expressed by the number of pixels that make up its width and height; the first number being addressing its width, while the second addressing its height (e.g. 1080 x 1350 for portrait images).</p>
<h3>Landscape</h3>
<p>The¬†<strong>landscape aspect ratio¬†</strong>is 1.91:1. The optimal size for landscape-oriented photos is 1080 by 608 pixels.</p>
<p>Since they&#8217;re longer horizontally, this aspect ratio is perfect for those lengthy images of scenery and cityscapes. However, they generally have a poor effect on users, marketing-wise.</p>
<p>To fit within your phone screen, Instagram must therefore downsize your landscape image, while still retaining its width. As a result, you end up with a photo that&#8217;s half the size of a default, &#8220;square&#8221; Instagram photo.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1643" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio.jpg" alt="Instagram landscape aspect ratio" width="1002" height="725" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio.jpg 1002w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio-300x217.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio-768x556.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px" /></p>
<p>Users scrolling through their feed are therefore more likely to skip over your image, in favour of larger ones that command more attention.</p>
<p>To get around this, some users opt to slice their landscape image into multiple photos, uploading them as a carousel post. Viewers can then view the full landscape photo in parts (each part as its own carousel photo); without having to sacrifice the size of the post.</p>
<div id="attachment_1645" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1645" class="size-full wp-image-1645" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/landscape-carousel-image-leonardociccola.jpg" alt="Using carousel images for landscape photos on Instagram" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/landscape-carousel-image-leonardociccola.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/landscape-carousel-image-leonardociccola-300x165.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/landscape-carousel-image-leonardociccola-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1645" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of leonardociccola (Instagram account).</p></div>
<h3>Portrait</h3>
<p>The¬†<strong>portrait aspect ratio¬†</strong>is 4:5. The optimal size for portrait-oriented photos is 1080 by 1350 pixels.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1644 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio.jpg" alt="Instagram portrait aspect ratio" width="807" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio.jpg 807w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-150x150.jpg 150w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-300x298.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-768x763.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 807px) 100vw, 807px" /></p>
<p>Portrait images take up the most space on one&#8217;s feed, making them the most marketable aspect ratio. As such, users are encouraged to optimize the full 1080 x 1350 image size.</p>
<h3>Square</h3>
<p>The &#8220;square&#8221; frame was once Instagram&#8217;s original, and only default size for photos.</p>
<p>The¬†<strong>square aspect ratio¬†</strong>is 1:1. The optimal size for square photos is 1080 by 1080 pixels.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1633" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-square-aspect-ratio.jpg" alt="Instagram square aspect ratio" width="817" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-square-aspect-ratio.jpg 817w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-square-aspect-ratio-300x294.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-square-aspect-ratio-768x754.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-square-aspect-ratio-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 817px) 100vw, 817px" /></p>
<p>Though the app will automatically crop your original photo into a square, users are recommended to keep to this aspect ratio as closely as possible. This way, you aren&#8217;t forced to cut away any important details of your image.</p>
<p>For all aspect ratios &#8211; uploading photos of a larger size is recommended, as Instagram will still reduce them to fit while losing none of the original quality.</p>
<h2>Cropping Your Photo (Using Instagram&#8217;s Native Tools)</h2>
<p>To achieve a landscape or portrait aspect ratio, simply choose an image from your camera roll. Then, tap on the &#8220;crop&#8221; icon at the bottom left-hand corner of your image.</p>
<p>Depending on the original sizing of your photo, Instagram will choose the appropriate aspect ratio to fit your image.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1630" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio.png" alt="How to crop photos on Instagram" width="814" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio.png 814w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio-300x295.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio-768x755.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-landscape-aspect-ratio-60x60.png 60w" sizes="(max-width: 814px) 100vw, 814px" /></p>
<p>This means if your image originally had a landscape orientation, the cropping tool will automatically fit it in the frame as such.</p>
<p>The same goes for portrait images.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1632" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio.jpg" alt="Instagram portrait aspect ratio" width="806" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio.jpg 806w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-150x150.jpg 150w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-300x298.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-768x762.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-portrait-aspect-ratio-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></p>
<p>If you wish to crop your image further, you can pinch and adjust the image on your screen as necessary. A 3&#215;3 grid will automatically appear as you tweak your image, helping you achieve the right balance and symmetry.</p>
<h2>Crop Photos for Instagram &#8211; Third-Party Apps</h2>
<p>The app&#8217;s built-in cropping tool, however, is fairly limited. Your image is restricted to the default sizing Instagram provides for each aspect ratio.</p>
<p>For larger, lengthy photos that surpass these set dimensions, users have no choice but to crop out a few details.</p>
<p>But with a third-party app, you may just save your entire photo.</p>
<h3>InShot</h3>
<p>InShot is a photo and video editing app available on both Android and Apple devices.</p>
<p>Looking to upload a portrait or landscape photo without having to sacrifice a single detail? InShot ensures your image fits tightly within Instagram&#8217;s square dimensions.</p>
<p>Upon uploading a photo to InShot, the app reduces its size to fit a 1:1 square ratio.</p>
<div id="attachment_1625" style="width: 539px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1625" class="size-full wp-image-1625" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-aspect-ratio-background.jpg" alt="InShot - optimizing Instagram's aspect ratio" width="529" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-aspect-ratio-background.jpg 529w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-aspect-ratio-background-198x300.jpg 198w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1625" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of InShot.</p></div>
<p>This leaves you with all the details of your original image, though rather than being framed by boring white borders (or none at all); InShot optimizes the square aspect ratio by filling in this empty space with a blurred, zoomed-in image of your original photo.</p>
<p>The result is a full, detailed image with an aesthetically-pleasing backdrop. You needn&#8217;t reduce your landscape photos to a tiny size, either!</p>
<p>If you wish, you even have the flexibility of resizing and rotating your photo within this frame.</p>
<div id="attachment_1623" style="width: 526px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1623" class="size-full wp-image-1623" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-adjust-photo.jpg" alt="Crop photos for Instagram - InShot app" width="516" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-adjust-photo.jpg 516w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-adjust-photo-194x300.jpg 194w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1623" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of InShot.</p></div>
<p>InShot also provides extra cropping options, allowing users to choose from the varying aspect ratios provided on Instagram, and more.</p>
<div id="attachment_1624" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1624" class="size-full wp-image-1624" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-aspect-ratio.jpg" alt="Crop photos for Instagram - InShot" width="428" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-aspect-ratio.jpg 428w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-inshot-aspect-ratio-161x300.jpg 161w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1624" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of InShot.</p></div>
<p>Additionally, the app provides a generous selection of filters, stickers, and text effects to further spice up your photo.</p>
<div id="attachment_1641" style="width: 484px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1641" class="size-full wp-image-1641" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/inshot-filter-effects.png" alt="InShot app filters" width="474" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/inshot-filter-effects.png 474w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/inshot-filter-effects-178x300.png 178w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1641" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of InShot.</p></div>
<p>InShot isn&#8217;t just a tool for editing images, however. With their wide range of intuitive features, users can also create collages, edit videos, or create a video from scratch.</p>
<h3>Kapwing</h3>
<p>Kapwing is another creative online platform that offers a variety of tools for any avid Instagrammer.</p>
<p>Available for free on desktop (though extra storage will cost users a premuim price of $20 a month), its most basic feature is the Kapwing Studio. Here, users can edit their Instagram images with an extensive suite featuring sticker, text, and even animation options.</p>
<div id="attachment_1627" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1627" class="size-full wp-image-1627" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio.jpg" alt="Crop photos for Instagram - Kapwing Studio" width="1000" height="431" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-300x129.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-768x331.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1627" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Kapwing.</p></div>
<p>Of course, this menu also offers a cropping tool; allowing users to pick from a selection of aspect ratios that suit their image best.</p>
<div id="attachment_1628" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1628" class="size-full wp-image-1628" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-crop-tool.png" alt="Kapwing Studio - cropping aspect ratios" width="1000" height="440" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-crop-tool.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-crop-tool-300x132.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-crop-tool-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1628" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Kapwing.</p></div>
<p>Though these default options are available, users can still click and adjust the cropping frame to their liking.</p>
<p>Users can also choose to customize their photo&#8217;s exact output dimensions. By clicking on¬† &#8220;Custom Size&#8221; from the canvas size options, you can then enter the exact width and height you want for your image. There&#8217;s also an option to &#8220;lock proportions&#8221; to ensure it stays within the same aspect ratio.</p>
<div id="attachment_1629" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1629" class="size-full wp-image-1629" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-custom-size.jpg" alt="Kapwing Studio - custom sizing" width="1000" height="534" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-custom-size.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-custom-size-300x160.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-studio-custom-size-768x410.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1629" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Kapwing.</p></div>
<p>Kapwing doesn&#8217;t neglect the importance of Instagram videos, however. Their online video cropper adjusts your media to fit the right proportions for your feed. Simply upload your video and select from their menu of resizing options; and trim your video if necessary.</p>
<div id="attachment_1626" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1626" class="size-full wp-image-1626" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-cropping-videos.png" alt="Kapwing - Crop Videos" width="1000" height="695" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-cropping-videos.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-cropping-videos-300x209.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/crop-photos-for-instagram-kapwing-cropping-videos-768x534.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1626" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Kapwing.</p></div>
<h2>Cropping Makes for Better, More Professional-Looking Instagram Photos</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve run through the importance of composition, cropping, and the availability of online editing tools; you&#8217;re hopefully better-equipped for posting higher-quality photos (and videos!) on Instagram. Maintaining a feed of cohesive, focused images is a common objective among users, and these cropping techniques can help achieve just that.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you need an Instagram name generator to give you some IG inspiration?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Your Instagram username is one of the most valuable assets you have on social media. It dictates your digital identity, determines your Instagram URL, and even makes it easier to form deeper connections with your target audience.</p>
<p>However, if you want your name to have the right impact, you&#8217;ll need to choose it with care.</p>
<p>Now that Instagram has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/20/instagram-1-billion-users/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1 billion monthly active users</a>, it&#8217;s very difficult to find a username that hasn&#8217;t already been taken. If you&#8217;ve spent days, or even weeks brainstorming suggestions and still haven&#8217;t come up with something that&#8217;s Instagrammable, then the following tips, username generators, and insights will help.</p>
<h2>Changing your Instagram Username: Pros and Cons</h2>
<p>Before you start plugging ideas into an Instagram name generator, it&#8217;s worth thinking about what your username means to your Instagram account.</p>
<p>Crucially, your username is the thing that appears after the @symbol when someone searches for you on Instagram. It&#8217;s also the phrase at the end of your Instagram URL. For instance, Kim Kardashian&#8217;s username is @KimKardashian, but her Instagram name or business name is Kim Kardashian West.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1762" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kimk-bio.jpg" alt="" width="667" height="291" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kimk-bio.jpg 667w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kimk-bio-300x131.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /></p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.techlicious.com/tip/instagram-101-understanding-the-basics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">your username or handle</a> is the first thing people look for when they&#8217;re trying to find you on Instagram, it&#8217;s essential to get it right.</p>
<p>While Instagram does allow you to change your username if you no longer like it, there are some problems with this strategy. For instance, any shoutouts with hashtags rather than @mentions created with your old name won&#8217;t update on influencer and partner accounts. Additionally, the more you change your username, the more you&#8217;ll confuse your audience, <a href="http://moirastudio.com/2018/08/29/changing-instagram-username-problems-how-to/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">creating issues with brand recognition</a>.</p>
<p>Changing your Instagram username also means that any links on other websites that link back to your page, or copies of your handle on printed brand materials won&#8217;t lead anywhere. In other words &#8211; it&#8217;s a bigger job than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>The best option is to avoid the change and get your name right first time around.</p>
<h2>Top Tips for Choosing your Instagram Username</h2>
<p>To ensure that you don&#8217;t have to waste time and money changing your Instagram username a few years after you start your account, use the following steps to prepare yourself for making the right choice first-time around.</p>
<h2>1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Choose the Right Username Style</h2>
<p>There are different kinds of name that you can choose from depending on the type of Instagram account that you&#8217;re running. For instance. If you&#8217;re running a business profile, you&#8217;ll need a very different kind of name compared to if you&#8217;re managing a personal account.</p>
<ul>
<li>For personal accounts, keep your name as close to your own name as possible. The idea is to let your reputation do the talking for your profile. Look at @GaryVee, for instance.</li>
<li>Business accounts, stick to either your company&#8217;s title or something related. For instance #WayfinderSigns or #WayfinderProducts</li>
<li>Curation accounts, use a name that describes what you&#8217;re going to be focusing on. For instance, if you&#8217;re sharing inspirational quotes, you might use @PowerOfPositivity or #InstaInspiration</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Make your Instagram Username Relevant</h2>
<p>Whatever the kind of Instagram profile you&#8217;re running, it&#8217;s essential to make sure that your name is relevant. If you&#8217;re not relying on your personal or professional brand to tell your audience what your account is all about, try to give them a hint in your username instead.</p>
<p>For instance, it&#8217;s easy to guess what <a href="https://www.instagram.com/iam.pugcrazy/?hl=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">the account @iam.pugcrazy</a> would be focusing on.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1761" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pugcrazy.jpg" alt="" width="801" height="219" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pugcrazy.jpg 801w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pugcrazy-300x82.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pugcrazy-768x210.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re struggling for inspiration for a curated or influencer account, think about the kind of content you&#8217;re going to produce for your audience, and what themes you&#8217;ll be looking at. This will help you a great deal when it comes to using a username generator.</p>
<h2>3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Do your Homework</h2>
<p>Before you start looking for an Instagram name generator, it&#8217;s essential to understand what kind of names are going to speak to your audience. For instance, it might help to examine some of the titles that belong to leading companies or individuals in your niche. What sort of words and themes have they focused on?</p>
<p>Consider your target audience too. What sort of words will they be searching for when they start looking for content on Instagram? You can look at <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">trending hashtags</a> to help you out here. Any phrase that gets a lot of material and searches is sure to attract attention when used in a username.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth making a list of any inappropriate words that you don&#8217;t want to use in your name. Some words seem perfectly innocent until you put them into an Instagram username and your audience starts issuing complaints. Get a selection of people to read your name out loud to make sure it&#8217;s safe.</p>
<h2>The Best Instagram Name Generators</h2>
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to start using your username generator to gather inspiration.</p>
<p>Remember, not all of the <a href="https://upleap.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-instagram-username/" data-wpel-link="internal">names that you generate</a> from these automated tools will be effective. You&#8217;ll probably end up with hundreds of choices, but only a handful that will appeal to your audience. Keep it simple by getting rid of anything that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to spell</li>
<li>Longer than 9 characters</li>
<li>Riddled with punctuation and underscores</li>
<li>Differentiated by a number</li>
<li>Marred by offensive language.</li>
</ul>
<p>With those rules in mind, check out the following tools:</p>
<h2>1.¬†¬†¬†¬† SpinXO</h2>
<p>SpinXO is a fun and simple username generator, intended to give you some basic ideas to start with when you&#8217;re creating your social media accounts. You enter a handful of details, like your nickname, your hobbies, things you like and essential words, and the algorithm will spit out 30 potential Insta names.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that some of these names may already be taken, so you&#8217;ll need to check their availability. Additionally, we&#8217;d recommend not using the &#8220;numbers&#8221; option, as this will reduce the quality of the titles you get.</p>
<h2>2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Jimpix</h2>
<p>Jimpix is another easy-to-use Instagram name generator that allows you to enter a name or keyword and choose from a wide range of categories. The categories available help to ensure that your name remains relevant to your target audience. However, you can choose to pick a name entirely at random too &#8211; though we&#8217;d recommend against that.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1760" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jimpix.png" alt="" width="520" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jimpix.png 520w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jimpix-300x288.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing particularly complicated about this tool, which makes it great for people who don&#8217;t have a lot of experience with online apps. Once again, you&#8217;ll need to check the availability of any titles generated for you, however.</p>
<h2>3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Username Generator</h2>
<p>Username generator is a tool that wasn&#8217;t designed specifically for Instagram. Instead, this software works to deliver usernames regardless of what tool or app you&#8217;re using. You can choose from a host of <a href="https://www.username-generator.org/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pre-established &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;funny&#8221; usernames</a> that are listed on the website homepage. Alternatively, there&#8217;s the option to enter your name or a keyword and have the algorithm deliver something new.</p>
<p>There are specific categories reserved for people in search of an Instagram username. What&#8217;s more, you can save names that you like to a list if you want to keep searching for a while before making your choice. This tool will also helpfully count the number of characters in your name &#8211; so you don&#8217;t go over Instagram&#8217;s limits.</p>
<h2>4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Lingojam</h2>
<p>Lingojam is another <a href="https://lingojam.com/InstagramNameGenerator" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram name generator</a> that makes coming up with unique titles easier for people who want to make the most out of their social profile. The user interface might not be the most attractive thing you&#8217;ve seen online &#8211; but it gets the job done. You can add a seed word (keyword) or your actual name to the first box on the site, and the second box will automatically show suggestions based on what you enter.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1759" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lingojam.jpg" alt="" width="908" height="610" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lingojam.jpg 908w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lingojam-300x202.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lingojam-768x516.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" /></p>
<p>Lingojam is one of the simplest name generators online, and it comes with options to enter tips on how you think the software can be improved if you have any advice.</p>
<h2>5.¬†¬†¬†¬† Username Buddy</h2>
<p>Finally, Username buddy is a random name generator that you can use for Instagram, your email address, or virtually any other site that requires a digital identity. The tool uses a basic algorithm to throw random words and letters to create something unique that you can use online. Unlike other username generators, this option allows you to choose a separate suffix and prefix for your name.</p>
<p>That means that you can <a href="https://www.usernamebuddy.com/random-username-generator/?utm_campaign=free-traffic&amp;utm_source=solutions-softonic-com&amp;utm_medium=referral" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">combine multiple words</a> into one title, rather than working off a single keyword. Username buddy also offers the opportunity to choose a starting letter if you want to make sure that your title begins a specific way. You can also look for names that include linguistic features like alliteration, to make your choice more memorable.</p>
<h2>What to Do After Choosing your Instagram Username</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve collected a wide range of ideas from your username generator, you&#8217;ll still have a bit of work to do before you begin building your Insta strategy. For instance, it&#8217;s essential to check that your Instagram username is available first, by searching for it online making sure that it hasn&#8217;t been claimed or trademarked elsewhere.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth running your name by several members of your team if you&#8217;re launching an Instagram profile for your business. This will ensure that the title you choose makes sense and that there&#8217;s no spelling mistakes or embarrassing errors that you&#8217;ve looked over.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re changing your username after having already established your presence on social media, then there&#8217;s even more work to do. For instance, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update all of your other social media profiles and blog information to ensure that your name is consistent and accurate across the web.</li>
<li>Update your Instagram handle on any newsletters or guest posting bios that you use online.</li>
<li>Make sure you ask any influencers you&#8217;ve worked with recently to update their hashtags and mentions of your brand.</li>
<li>Change any branded hashtags on your website to suit your new username where necessary.</li>
<li>Make sure that your users have the right information <a href="https://upleap.com/blog/how-to-host-your-first-instagram-contest/" data-wpel-link="internal">for any contests or promotions</a> you have scheduled now or in the coming weeks.</li>
<li>Update any printed materials or offline assets that contain your Instagram handle</li>
</ul>
<p>One good piece of news is that when you upgrade your Instagram username, the Instagram algorithm will also automatically update your username when it&#8217;s mentioned in a tag. This ensures that you don&#8217;t have to replace and update all of your existing content.</p>
<p>However, this doesn&#8217;t apply to any branded hashtags you&#8217;ve been using to collect user-generated content. If your current hashtags are no longer relevant, you&#8217;ll need to run a campaign asking your customers to change the tags they&#8217;ve been using.</p>
<h2>Improving your Instagram Username</h2>
<p>Your Instagram username or handle is more important than most people realize.</p>
<p>On a visual channel like Instagram, it&#8217;s easy to assume that so long as you&#8217;re publishing the right material, nothing else matters. However, the truth is that there are many different things that come together to create a successful Instagram presence. Your complete profile, including your pictures, Instagram bio, username, and more will help you stand out online.</p>
<p>Fail to get all of your Instagram profile right, and you risk losing the attention of your target audience, and the respect of your existing followers.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are ways to get inspiration if you&#8217;re struggling. Instagram name generators can give you a starting point and act as a crucial muse. You could even use all of the tools we mentioned above to get the widest selection of suggestions.</p>
<p>Good luck finding the right username. Remember, you can always rely on SocialFollow for tips and tricks on how to get the most out of your Instagram strategy. Subscribe today to stay up-to-date with our latest posts, articles, and guides.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you here for some Instagram bio ideas because your bio just isn&#8217;t having the right impact?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all been there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to spruce up your profile picture by editing it on Canva or adding a unique filter. You can even make your account easier to find by picking a name that&#8217;s easy to spell and search for. However, when it comes to Instagram bios &#8211; the 150 characters of information that tells people what to expect from your brand, the mind has a habit of going blank.</p>
<p>Now that 80% of Instagram users are <a href="https://business.instagram.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">following at least 1 business</a>, you can&#8217;t afford to take risks with the impression that your bio makes. Get this one little thing wrong, and you could send your followers running in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Instagram bios don&#8217;t have to be the complex mystery that you think they are.</p>
<p>The truth is, there are plenty of fun and interesting ways to spruce up your home page and get people involved in deeper connections with your brand.</p>
<p>Here are our top Instagram bio ideas to get you started.</p>
<h2>Top 8 Instagram Bio Ideas</h2>
<h3>1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Make Your Value Abundantly Clear</h3>
<p>Thanks to the rise of the digital world, a physical shop-front, and business card aren&#8217;t the only way to introduce people to your company anymore. Instagram bios can also have a resounding impact on how people think and feel about your organization. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to quickly, clearly and concisely outline what makes you special.</p>
<p>Take a look <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hubspot/?hl=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">at HubSpot&#8217;s bio</a>, for instance:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1756 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hubspot-bio.jpg" alt="Hubspot Instagram" width="754" height="296" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hubspot-bio.jpg 754w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hubspot-bio-300x118.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 754px) 100vw, 754px" /></p>
<p>In just a few words, Hubspot outlines their commitment to helping companies grow. There&#8217;s a branded hashtag #GrowBetter to encourage user-generated content, a range of unique highlights sharing valuable content, and a handy bit.ly link too. HubSpot is proof that an Instagram bio doesn&#8217;t need to be long to be effective. Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s the USP of your business, and how can you convey it in a concise way?</li>
<li>How can you encourage engagement with your audience instantly: e.g., Using hashtags, highlights, and a link to your most valuable pages.</li>
<li>Where can people learn more about your company: e.g., clicking on your link or contact options, or even checking out your Stories Highlights.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Expand Your Instagram Bio Link</h3>
<p>Not everyone can refine the nature of their business into a few words like HubSpot. Unfortunately, Instagram has a significant flaw for marketers to deal with these days. You only have 150 characters to work with, and you only get a single link to drive people back to other content on your site.</p>
<p>Since you can&#8217;t add extra words to your Instagram bio, the only way to expand it is to make the most out of that single link. You can do this with a <a href="https://bio.fm/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">tool like Bio.fm</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1754" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bio.fm_.png" alt="Bio.fm" width="1024" height="595" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bio.fm_.png 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bio.fm_-300x174.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bio.fm_-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Primarily, Bio.fm is a handy Instagram bio idea that allows you to promote multiple things at once with one link, so you don&#8217;t have to keep switching out the URL on your profile. It also allows you to make your Instagram posts clickable, so people can track down the products in their favorite images or find out more about one of your recent videos.</p>
<p>You can also sync Bio.FM with other social profiles, adding your latest Pins from Pinterest and YouTube videos to the mix. It&#8217;s an excellent way to align your entire social strategy.</p>
<h3>3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Show Your Personality</h3>
<p>Making the most of your Instagram bio isn&#8217;t just about driving people to your website or letting people know what you do. You also need to make sure that people understand who you are and why you&#8217;re different from the competition. This is your chance to let your unique personality shine through.</p>
<p>Take a look at the Old Spice Instagram page, for instance. If you&#8217;ve been following the Old Spice advertising campaigns on other social media channels and your TV, you&#8217;ll know that this is a company all about fun. The branded profile image on the company&#8217;s account lets you know you&#8217;re dealing with the real company, as does the verified tick. However, the bio text &#8220;MUSCLES. SMELLS. LAZERS, COUPONS, GIFS&#8221; highlights the playful nature of the brand.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1753" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/oldspice.jpg" alt="Old Spice Instagram bio" width="761" height="295" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/oldspice.jpg 761w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/oldspice-300x116.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></p>
<p>Even better, this bio also tells followers precisely what they can expect if they stay tuned to the Old Spice page.</p>
<p>The compelling Instagram Bio above <a href="https://www.inc.com/articles/201108/5-marketing-lessons-from-old-spice.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">from Old Spice</a> is just another example of how brands can align their personalities across all social media channels to develop deeper connections with their audience.</p>
<h3>4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Speak your Customer&#8217;s Language</h3>
<p>You probably already know that there are a lot of different people using Instagram these days, and they&#8217;re not all online looking for the same thing. The more you know about your target audience, the easier it will be to craft a bio that really speaks to the right people. For instance, while some people will be looking for professionalism in the companies that they connect with on Instagram, others will be looking for a more friendly and playful attitude.</p>
<p>For instance, a great way to speak your customer&#8217;s language if you know you&#8217;re dealing with a younger audience is to embed emojis into your Instagram bio. Check <a href="https://www.instagram.com/divinityla/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">out Divinity LA Bracelets</a>, for instance. They use emojis in their Bio to reinforce their values. For example, they use a hand for handcrafted, the planet earth to represent their sustainable strategies, and hearts to show their passion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1752" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/divinityla.png" alt="DivinityLA Instagram bio" width="896" height="199" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/divinityla.png 896w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/divinityla-300x67.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/divinityla-768x171.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px" /></p>
<p>Remember to make sure that you understand what each emoji you&#8217;re using means before you place it on your bio, however. The last thing you want to do is make the wrong impression by using an image with an underlying negative meaning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth splitting your emojis up by getting the layout of your Instagram bio right too. Remember that it pays to use separate lines on the page to make different points when you can.</p>
<h3>5.¬†¬†¬†¬† Make the Most of Hashtags In Your Instagram Bio</h3>
<p>Hashtags are one of the most valuable features on Instagram &#8211; and they&#8217;re not just for your posts and Stories either. Using hashtags is a great Instagram bio idea too that can help you to develop stronger connections with your target audience and let them know what they can expect from your account. Additionally, if you include a branded hashtag on your bio, you could even encourage your followers to help you build out your profile with user-generated content.</p>
<p>For instance, if you visit the Pottery Barn page on Instagram, you&#8217;ll notice that the company actively encourages followers to take part in sharing their own interior design ideas by tagging @PotteryBarn in the caption. In the past, the brand has also used branded hashtags to the same effect, like #MyPotteryBarn. You can still find people using that tag today.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1751 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pottery-barn.jpg" alt="pottery barn Instagram" width="727" height="342" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pottery-barn.jpg 727w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pottery-barn-300x141.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" /></p>
<p>Choose the right hashtag, and you&#8217;ll develop a considerable backlog of user-generated content that you can turn to whenever you&#8217;re looking for inspiration, or you need to show your audience how much you value their input. Additionally, you can also use the UGC created by your followers as social proof, reminding future customers that you&#8217;re a credible and trustworthy brand.</p>
<h3>6.¬†¬†¬†¬† Keep your Audience Informed with Highlights</h3>
<p>One of the best things you can do with your Instagram bio is to teach your customers everything they need to know about your business. Often, it&#8217;s challenging to do this when you only have about 150 characters to work with and just one link. That&#8217;s why countless brands have begun taking advantage of a newer feature on Instagram called &#8220;Highlights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Highlights are saved stories that appear at the top of your Instagram feed, just below your Bio. Most companies regard these little icons to be extensions of the Instagram Bio and use them to share things like customer testimonials, information about new product lines, and more. For instance, if you visit the Lush UK page on Instagram, you&#8217;ll see a handful of Highlights showcasing their latest makeup range.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1750" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lush-bio.jpg" alt="lush Instagram bio" width="782" height="308" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lush-bio.jpg 782w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lush-bio-300x118.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lush-bio-768x302.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<p>Notice that Lush also have their own #Lush Community hashtag included in their Instagram Bio too, to help generate extra user-generated content.</p>
<p>Another way that you can help users to learn about you through your Instagram Bio is by including contact buttons that give your followers an easier way to reach out to members of your team. This is a feature that&#8217;s only available for people with a business profile on Instagram, so it&#8217;s worth switching away from personal profiles if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>
<h3>7.¬†¬†¬†¬† Draw Attention to New Promotional Offers</h3>
<p>If you want to make the most out of your Instagram Bio link, but you&#8217;re not interested in using a tool like Bio.FM, then the best thing you can do to educate and inform your audience, is provide them with plenty of fresh new links week after week. This is a great way to draw attention to some of the more recent offers that you&#8217;re running in your company, or the new products that you have for sale.</p>
<p>For instance, the Music Streaming company, Spotify regularly changes up its Bio link with new content depending on the artist that it&#8217;s featuring at any given time. For instance, when they were focusing on David Bowie, their link was Spot.fi/DavidBowie, and they filled their Instagram news feed with pictures of Bowie too.</p>
<p>Now the focus goes to Spoti.fi/DenzelSingles, complete with interesting videos from IGTV, slideshows, and other useful content to help the company make the most of their new promotion. It&#8217;s timely promotional strategies like this that make Spotify such a popular company to follow on Instagram.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1749" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify Instagram bio" width="733" height="599" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify.jpg 733w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/spotify-300x245.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, because Spotify links users to a web player, rather than a home page or landing page, Spotify also makes sure that users can start getting a feel for the service as quickly as possible. It&#8217;s a great way for people who aren&#8217;t familiar with Spotify to see for themselves how easy and intuitive the interface can be.</p>
<h3>8.¬†¬†¬†¬† Create a Powerful Instagram Bio Call-to-Action</h3>
<p>Just like any other marketing campaign, the purpose of your Instagram profile isn&#8217;t just to share beautiful pictures with the world. It&#8217;s about making your audience act. It&#8217;s not enough to just tell people what you do and include a bio link hoping that they&#8217;ll click through to your website. You also need to use basic marketing principles to convince people that they should be clicking on that link. For instance, look at how @HelloFresh motivates customers to visit their website with the guarantee of $30 off their first order.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1748 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hello-fresh.jpg" alt="Hello Fresh Instagram bio" width="771" height="345" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hello-fresh.jpg 771w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hello-fresh-300x134.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hello-fresh-768x344.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re designing the ultimate Instagram bio, it&#8217;s essential to think about how you can convince your audience to take the next step in their relationship with your brand. In HelloFresh&#8217;s bio above, you can see that audience members get everything they need to make an informed decision about working with and following the company.</p>
<p>There are highlights that include insights into the kind of menu that you can get when you subscribe with HelloFresh, snippets from the company&#8217;s blog, and even a branded hashtag #HelloFreshPics, where people can send int heir user-generated content.</p>
<p>Combine all of that useful information with a free offer, and it&#8217;s no wonder that HelloFresh customers go streaming back to the company&#8217;s website from their Instagram feed.</p>
<p>Pro tip: If the link you&#8217;re using in your bio isn&#8217;t as compact as the one from Hello Fresh above, make sure that you use a link-shortening tool, so you don&#8217;t scare your customers off.</p>
<h2>Creating Your Instagram Bio</h2>
<p>Instagram bios are something that many businesses take for granted when they&#8217;re setting up their new social media presence. However, the truth is that just like your profile picture and the content you share, your bio has a powerful role to play in the way that people interact with your brand on social media. Within 150 characters, you&#8217;ll need to tell your followers all about what your business does and convince them that your company is valuable enough to deserve their attention.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all strategy for the perfect bio, the Instagram bio ideas above will set you off on the right track to creating a fantastic profile for your Instagram campaign. Remember, subscribe with SocialFollow for more insights on how to make the most of your Instagram strategy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram saves the things we put up. That means old selfies, cat pictures, and your Instagram search history. Your Instagram posts are forever, and so is your Instagram search history.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While for most of us this just means the #cats hashtag will pop up over and over again, for some it may cause some blushes or relationship problems. Remember that what you do on the internet stays on the internet.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news: you can delete your Instagram search history.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Instagram search history plays a bigger role in the overall Instagram experience than you might think. Your search history will constantly bring up people you‚Äôve searched before. That means if you‚Äôve stalked your ex, they will pop up every time you want to search something on Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of us have looked up a crush, a friend, someone you just met, or a celebrity on Instagram. Instagram remembers this and will show you these profiles in the search bar under ‚ÄúSuggestions.‚Äù If you want to avoid any potential embarrassment, you may want to delete your Instagram search history.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you delete your history, you won‚Äôt be able to view it directly. But you can easily go back and search your favorite profiles and hashtags again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have all looked up someone on Instagram perhaps a little too intensely.

Doesn‚Äôt Instagram know you‚Äôve moved on?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, it doesn‚Äôt. But here‚Äôs how you can tell it:¬†</span></p>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†Choose ‚ÄúTop‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccounts.‚Äù</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap and hold the user you‚Äôd no longer like to see. Choose ‚ÄúHide.‚Äù</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1776 size-medium" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6480-300x290.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing the top accounts saved in Instagram search history" width="300" height="290" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6480-300x290.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_6480.jpg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>

</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôve attempted to clear your Instagram search history and it‚Äôs still showing up, don‚Äôt fret. Here‚Äôs how you can fix it:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restart your device.¬†</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classic ‚ÄúHave you tried turning it off and on again?‚Äù is actually pretty solid advice. Before you delete your Instagram altogether, try this simple trick. If that doesn‚Äôt work, move on to‚Ä¶</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†Clear your App Cache</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you‚Äôre on an Android, you may need to clear the Instagram app‚Äôs cache to get rid of your Instagram search history.¬†</span></p>
<ol>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†Restart your device.¬†</span></li>
</ol>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1777 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apple-connection-equipment-205421-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apple-connection-equipment-205421-300x200.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apple-connection-equipment-205421-768x512.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/apple-connection-equipment-205421-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be warned that clearing the app cache will log you out and delete your password from memory. Make sure you write it down before continuing!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uninstall Instagram</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;ve tried everything above and it still doesn&#8217;t work, there&#8217;s still hope. As a last resort, you can uninstall the Instagram app.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†Find ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô on your phone and go to the App Management. Then, tap on Instagram.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†Tap on ‚ÄòUninstall‚Äô, or ‚ÄòDelete‚Äô as shown on some devices. This will instantly remove the app from your device.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uninstall the app from Google Play store.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap and hold the Instagram app until it wiggles. Then, tap on the ‚ÄòX‚Äô button at the top (do this for iPhone).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do whatever that is the easiest for you. Once you have uninstalled the app, restart your device then reinstall the Instagram app again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deleting your Instagram search history is much easier than it may seem. Follow these steps and you‚Äôll have a clear Instagram search history in no time.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how to post to Instagram from PC &#8211; you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p>Instagram might be one of the most popular social media platforms in the world &#8211; but it does make life more difficult for companies sometimes. For instance, you can&#8217;t share more than one link in your bio on Instagram, which means that pulling people back to your website isn&#8217;t easy.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, if you&#8217;re the kind of person who likes to take professional photos on a camera before uploading to Instagram, then there&#8217;s no direct way to add photos or videos to your account from a PC.</p>
<p>If you want to upload to Instagram from PC, then you&#8217;re going to <a href="https://upleap.com/blog/how-to-upload-to-instagram-from-pc-or-mac-computers/" data-wpel-link="internal">need to use a workaround</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Can&#8217;t You Upload to Instagram from PC?</h2>
<p>So, why on earth would Instagram want to stop users from posting directly from their computers?</p>
<p>Well, the company wants to encourage authentic usage of the app. In other words, Instagram wants you to upload pictures and images that are taken at the moment and uploaded directly from your phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this means that you&#8217;re limited to the quality available from your phone camera &#8211; which might not be enough to earn the attention of millions of followers, now that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-followed_Instagram_accounts" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram is so popular</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to post to Instagram from PC involves either using a desktop browser workaround, accessing a scheduler to do the uploading for you, or using a third-party app. Let&#8217;s take a look at each of the ways that you can upload to Instagram from PC, Mac, or virtually any browser.</p>
<h2>How to Post to Instagram from your PC Browser</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with most common option: the browser workaround.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to sign-up for scheduling service, and you&#8217;re bored of relying on endless third-party tools for your social media marketing, then this is the most straightforward option. Most computer browsers come with an option that allows users to change <a href="https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">their &#8220;user-agent&#8221; setting</a>. This basically changes the way that your browser talks to certain websites.</p>
<p>Change your user agent, and you can convince Instagram that you&#8217;re logging in from a smartphone, even when you aren&#8217;t.</p>
<h3>If You&#8217;re Using Safari‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re on a Mac computer, you&#8217;ll need to enable the Developer menu to start messing around with user settings. To do this, go into the &#8220;Preferences&#8221; menu underneath the Safari tab:</p>
<p>From there, you can click on &#8220;Advanced&#8221; to take you into the menu that allows you to &#8220;Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar.&#8221; The Develop menu will appear at the top of your Safari page. Click on that, then scroll down to User-Agent. Here, you&#8217;ll get a separate list of options for how you want your browser to appear. You&#8217;ll need to select &#8220;iPhone&#8221; to post to Instagram from PC.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve clicked on the iPhone view option, you&#8217;ll see your page as though it was on a mobile device. When this happens, the &#8220;Upload&#8221; button you typically get when you&#8217;re browsing on your phone will appear on the bottom of the page. All you need to do now is click on Upload, choose the file you want to share, and write a caption, as normal.</p>
<h3>If You&#8217;re Using Google Chrome‚Ä¶</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a Mac user, then there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;ll be using Google Chrome. The Chrome browser has a <a href="https://usefyi.com/chrome-history/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">70% market share</a> &#8211; with millions of users. In your Chrome browser, log into your Instagram account, then open your Chrome Developer tools by pressing Ctrl, Shift, and J.</p>
<p>Immediately, the developer console will appear on the right-hand side of your page. To view your Instagram feed just like it appears on your phone, press Ctrl, Shift, and M, or click on the small icon that looks like a phone here:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1986" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-post-to-pc.jpg" alt="" width="1647" height="694" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-post-to-pc.jpg 1647w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-post-to-pc-300x126.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-post-to-pc-768x324.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-post-to-pc-1024x431.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1647px) 100vw, 1647px" /></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need to find the exact match to the phone you use to upload to Instagram from PC, but some people will prefer to do this. Click on the drop-down menu at the top of the screen and select the make and model of your phone. Now, your Instagram profile will appear just as it does on your phone, complete with the option to post to Instagram from PC.</p>
<p>Click on the Upload icon to add a photo or video from your files, and remember to add a caption and filters, just as you would on your phone.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1985" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/INSTAGRAM-Login.png" alt="" width="443" height="901" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/INSTAGRAM-Login.png 443w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/INSTAGRAM-Login-148x300.png 148w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>This is probably the simplest and most straightforward way to start posting from your PC immediately, but it can be a bit of a pain for people who don&#8217;t want to switch back and forth between browser views. Additionally, using the Chrome Developer Tools means that you won&#8217;t be able to upload multiple videos or photos at once. Although you can geotag your locations, use filters, and @Mention other users, you&#8217;re not ready to share your content simultaneously across other social platforms either.</p>
<h2>How to Post to Instagram from Adobe Lightroom</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for ways to upload to Instagram from PC, then there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;re using tools on your PC to enhance the appearance of your images before you publish them. If you happen to use Adobe Lightroom &#8211; one of the most popular editing tools, you will be able to upload images to Instagram directly from within Lightroom, using one of the <a href="https://www.lrinstagram.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">free plug-ins for the tool</a>.</p>
<p>The plugin does come with a one-time fee for registration of $10 &#8211; but that&#8217;s a small price to pay for convenience. To start using the Lightroom plugin, go to the LR/Instagram website, and download.</p>
<p>You should get access to the plugin as a ZIP file, which means that you&#8217;ll need to click on the file to expand it. Within Lightroom, click on the &#8220;File&#8221; tab, then scroll down to &#8220;Plug-In Manager&#8221; and select &#8220;Add.&#8221; This will open your file manager, where you&#8217;ll be able to find and install your Lightroom Instagram plugin.</p>
<p>With your new plugin installed, go to your Library in Lightroom where your Instagram photos are located. Here, you&#8217;ll see the LR/Instagram plugin listed under your Publish Services options in the sidebar. Double click on your plugin to use it and log into Instagram as normal. Once your credentials are authenticated, your Instagram profile photo will appear.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1984" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lightroom-publish.jpg" alt="How to post to Instagram from PC" width="608" height="372" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lightroom-publish.jpg 608w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/lightroom-publish-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" /></p>
<p>Once you have your Instagram information saved to the LR/Instagram plugin manager, this will create a published collection of Instagram photos that appear in your sidebar whenever you enter the Library view. Whenever you edit a photo in Lightroom, and you&#8217;re ready to publish it, you&#8217;ll be able to drag it into the Instagram Photos tab on your sidebar.</p>
<p>Click on the collection of Instagram Photos and choose the new image that you want to upload, then click on the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button to the right of your screen.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an Adobe Lightroom user, this will take a lot of the stress out of every time you need to post to Instagram from PC.</p>
<h2>How to Post to Instagram using a Scheduling Tool</h2>
<p>There are a lot of benefits to using an Instagram scheduling tool to simplify your social media marketing campaigns. With a scheduler, you can make sure that you&#8217;re always posting content at the time that best suits your audience. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ll be able to arrange for your material to appear according to promotional events and seasonal sales.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of using a scheduling tool, however, is that you can create Instagram posts in advance and publish them straight from your PC.</p>
<p>Though there are a lot of scheduling options out there, the most <a href="https://later.com/blog/post-on-instagram-from-pc/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">commonly preferred option is Later</a>. All you need to get started with this scheduler is a business account with Instagram, and a free account on Later. You can also upgrade to the premium version of Later if you prefer having access to more advanced tools and features.</p>
<p>Once you have your Later account set up, add your Instagram log-in details to the system so you can begin posting. To post to Instagram from PC, you&#8217;ll need to set up the Later &#8220;Auto Publish&#8221; feature. This allows users to schedule a video or photo and automatically have it publish to Instagram without any need for push notifications.</p>
<p>Later is one of the few automatic publishing options available today that are approved by Instagram, so you know you&#8217;re not going to get into any problems with the algorithm. What&#8217;s more, with the media library from Later, you can upload, store, and manage a range of videos and photos from anywhere with a robust Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Later.gif" alt="" width="800" height="520" /></p>
<p>Later also gives businesses and influencers the opportunity to drag and drop their photos into a calendar and see in advance how they&#8217;re going to look on their Instagram grid. This is particularly useful if you&#8217;re trying to create a specific aesthetic for your brand.</p>
<p>Aside from Later, you can also try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-schedule-instagram-posts/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">HootSuite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.hopperhq.com/blog/schedule-instagram-posts/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Hopper HQ</a></li>

<li><a href="https://sproutsocial.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Sprout Social </a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Post to Instagram using Third-Party Tools</h2>
<p>If using a browser workaround, Adobe Lightroom, or a scheduling tool doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, then there are several third-party apps you can try too. These solutions were specifically designed to assist people who want to upload to Instagram from PCs and Mac computers.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the most popular is Deskgram. This application allows Instagram users to upload videos and photos straight from their PC. What&#8217;s more, with Deskgram, you can create captions, tag accounts, and use all the hashtags that you like. Although there&#8217;s a free version of this tool, you won&#8217;t get the option to upload photos with it. Instead, you&#8217;ll need to <a href="http://app.deskgram.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">upgrade to the premium version</a> at $2.99 per month.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1983 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Deskgram.jpg" alt="Deskgram app" width="600" height="307" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Deskgram.jpg 600w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Deskgram-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>One of the things that makes Deskgram such a popular choice for those who want to post to Instagram from PC is the fact that it feels just like using your mobile Instagram app for posting. Once you&#8217;ve logged into your account, you can upload photos and compile your content just like you would on your phone.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Deskgram is just for uploading your photos to the web, however. You won&#8217;t be able to schedule your posts in advance, and you won&#8217;t have access to extra filters that aren&#8217;t available on Instagram.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac user, then you might prefer a solution specifically designed for Apple. <a href="https://getuplet.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Uplet is a downloadable Instagram tool</a> that&#8217;s exclusively designed for Mac. The great thing about this tool is that it allows users to upload videos and photos from their computers in bulk. What&#8217;s more, with Uplet, you can still add all your filters and captions as you usually would on Instagram.</p>
<p>Uplet offers the option to send posts and content to multiple Instagram accounts at once, and the interface is exceptionally straightforward.</p>
<p>Once again, there are no specific editing features or unique filters here, and you won&#8217;t be able to schedule your Instagram posts to publish in advance.</p>
<p>Tools like Uplete and Deskgram are intended to give you a version of your mobile Instagram experience on your browser when all else fails. If you want access to a range of Instagram marketing solutions at once, then you might need something more advanced.</p>
<h2>You&#8217;re Ready to Post to Instagram from PC!</h2>
<p>There you have it; those are just some of our top suggestions for people who want to upload to Instagram from PC, without the hassle. Although in an ideal world, Instagram would allow users to publish their content from any environment, the workarounds above are currently the best options for those who want to edit and manage their material from their computers, before uploading it to Instagram.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re building a business or brand on Instagram, your analytics should play a vital role in your overall marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s analytics offer valuable data on your current content performance; helping you craft better ways of growing your account and connecting with the right audiences.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an aspect of the platform that can&#8217;t be ignored &#8211;¬† especially for those developing an audience. The following guide breaks down the fundamentals of Instagram analytics, why they&#8217;re important, and the best tools for tracking such information.</p>
<h2>What are Instagram Analytics?</h2>
<p>Instagram analytics are a native feature on the platform. These stats offer users insight on their current content strategy, and how well it&#8217;s performing with their target audience.</p>
<p>Through your analytics, you&#8217;ll get a clear image of the type of content that works best, the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns, and demographics you resonate with most.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1649" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen.jpg" alt="Person analyzing graph" width="1000" height="499" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen-768x383.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This data isn&#8217;t just available for standard posts, however; users can also measure the performance of their Story and ad content.</p>
<p>Your analytics track information such as follower growth; content reach, engagement, and impressions; and the number of clickthroughs on your website URL.</p>
<h2>Why Do Instagram Analytics Matter?</h2>
<p>By keeping track of your analytics, you can then take the appropriate steps to improve your content quality and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>This data helps you understand what your audience likes and dislikes. Do your followers respond better to video content? What recent posts have lead to surges in engagement? Did a change in theme, subject matter, or brand image land well with your current audience, or did it fall short of previous content?</p>
<div id="attachment_1646" style="width: 1319px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1646" class="size-full wp-image-1646" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare.png" alt="Analytics tools for Instagram - Iconosquare" width="1309" height="499" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare.png 1309w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-300x114.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-768x293.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-1024x390.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1309px) 100vw, 1309px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1646" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Iconosquare.</p></div>
<p>It can also offer insight into the type of value your profile drives. Does your bio URL generate enough website traffic? Perhaps you gain high engagement on your posts &#8211; but not enough clickthroughs to your onli<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ne store. According to this data, you may need more engaging call-to-actions.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1674" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse.jpg" alt="Woman using computer mouse" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Understanding these analytical trends and patterns can help you refine your content strategy. In a sea of over <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started?ref=igb_carousel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">25 million business profiles</a>, this constant improvement is necessary to keep ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>So how does one track their Instagram Analytics?</p>
<h2>A Guide to Instagram Insights</h2>
<p>Your Instagram Insights provide plenty of built-in tools to help you measure your profile analytics, along with your audience and post metrics.</p>
<p>This native feature is exclusive to <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-business-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">business profiles</a> (if you&#8217;re looking to grow your brand on the platform, having an Instagram business account is crucial!), and is found in your profile menu at the top right-hand corner of your screen.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1650 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights.png" alt="Analytics tools for instagram - Instagram Insights" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-300x165.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-768x422.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Here, you&#8217;ll find your insights divided into three sections:¬†<strong>Content, Activity,¬†</strong>and<strong> Audience.¬†</strong></p>
<p>Your &#8220;Content&#8221; tab tracks all of the recent posts and stories you&#8217;ve uploaded during the week, with detailed insights (such as reach, impressions, and likes) provided for each.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1659 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-content.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Content tab" width="436" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-content.png 436w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-content-164x300.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<p>Under &#8220;Activity&#8221;, you&#8217;ll find weekly data on the any interactions taken on your content or profile. These stats will offer an analytical report on the days that garnered the most activity, along with the total number of accounts that have discovered your account in the previous week.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1651" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity.png" alt="Instagram metrics - profile activity" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity-300x165.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity-768x422.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Finally, your &#8220;Audience&#8221; tab displays your total number of followers and overall weekly growth. With recent updates to Instagram Insights, this section now shows graphed data on the number of follows and unfollows you&#8217;ve gained during the week.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1657 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience.png" alt="Instagram metrics - Audience insights" width="442" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience.png 442w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-166x300.png 166w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /></p>
<p>These insights also offer information on your most engaged demographics, including stats regarding gender, location, and age range.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1658 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age.png" alt="Instagram metrics - Audience insights" width="480" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age.png 480w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>One of the most valuable metrics provided is your followers&#8217; most active times &#8211; displayed by the hour or day (depending on your preference). Using this data, you can ensure future posts are uploaded during optimum times of engagement.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1676" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times.jpg" alt="Instagram - best engagement times" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times-300x212.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times-768x542.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<h2>The Top Instagram Metrics to Track</h2>
<p>To improve your content strategy, you&#8217;ll need a grasp of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. This is why analytics play such a vital role in your Instagram efforts &#8211; but which metrics are the most important ones to follow?</p>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ve broken down the top three Instagram metrics any profile should be tracking. These help best in measuring content performance and planning strategies for further success.</p>
<h3>Follower Growth</h3>
<p>Chances are, when you think of building your profile &#8211; the agitating <em><strong>follower count¬†</strong></em>comes to mind. This simple number plays a large factor in your overall content engagement and brand reputation.</p>
<p>The more followers you have, the more likes, comments, and views your content will get. With a high follower count, new viewers are also more likely to trust your profile, and view it as one of quality &#8211; possibly joining the club themselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_1661" style="width: 731px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1661" class="size-full wp-image-1661" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-followers.png" alt="@johnmayer - followers" width="721" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-followers.png 721w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-followers-270x300.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1661" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of johnmayer (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s therefore important to not only keep track of the followers you currently have, but your follower growth <strong>over time.¬†</strong>This will let you know if you&#8217;re on the right track, or if something needs to change in your current content strategy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1660" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-followers.png" alt="Instagram metrics - followers" width="615" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-followers.png 615w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-followers-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>
<p>For example, if the previous months have shown a steady increase in followers, then you&#8217;re likely doing something right. However, if your growth tends to fluctuate at an odd pattern &#8211; it may be worth examining the content or marketing-related reasons behind this.</p>
<p>From this data, you can then make further decisions to improve or change your marketing strategy altogether.</p>
<h3>Reach, Impressions, and Engagement</h3>
<p>When analyzing the success of your content, it helps to track these three fundamental metrics:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1662" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions.png" alt="Instagram metrics - reach and impressions" width="1000" height="386" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions-300x116.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions-768x296.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reach:¬†</strong>Your reach rate is measured by the number of unique users who viewed your posts, Stories, ads, and videos. This helps determine your content exposure, and whether you&#8217;ve been reaching new audiences on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Impressions:¬†</strong>These measure the total number of times your content was seen by viewers, and include multiple views by a single user.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement:¬†</strong>Arguably the most important metric of the three, engagement covers the number of unique profiles that have commented, liked, saved, or shared your content. Your engagement rate, however, does not count multiple comments by a single user.</li>
</ul>
<h4>On Standard Posts</h4>
<p>To view these metrics on a typical Instagram post, simply tap on the post you wish to analyze, and select the &#8220;View Insights&#8221; option underneath.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1669 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-analytics-view-insights.png" alt="Instagram post - &quot;View Insights&quot;" width="576" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-analytics-view-insights.png 576w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-analytics-view-insights-216x300.png 216w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>This will pop up all the likes, comments, shares, and saves your post has garnered over time. Here, you&#8217;ll find data on your reach and total impressions; including a breakdown of the sources from where your content was seen, such as the home feed, your hashtags, and your profile.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1671 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-post-insights.png" alt="Instagram analytics - post insights" width="454" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-post-insights.png 454w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-post-insights-170x300.png 170w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>These insights also count the number of profile visits driven from your posts.</p>
<p>To display multiple insights for multiple posts, enter your Instagram Insights and select &#8220;See All&#8221; in the &#8220;Content&#8221; section.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1652 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-content-see-all.png" alt="Instagram Insights - &quot;See all&quot; posts" width="745" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-content-see-all.png 745w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-content-see-all-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></p>
<p>This will pull up a feed of your posts, each displaying their reach numbers by default.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1653 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-feed-posts.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Feed posts" width="480" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-feed-posts.png 480w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-feed-posts-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>You can filter these posts by type, metric, and time period according to your preference.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1670 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-insights-feed-posts-filter.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Filtering feed posts" width="446" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-insights-feed-posts-filter.png 446w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-insights-feed-posts-filter-167x300.png 167w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></p>
<h4>Stories</h4>
<p>Similarly, your Instagram Insights can also provide the reach, impressions, and engagement rates of your Stories. These are accessed in the &#8220;Stories&#8221; section under &#8220;Posts&#8221; in your Insights page.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1655 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagement.png" alt="Analytics tools for Instagram - Story insights" width="768" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagement.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagement-288x300.png 288w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>By default, this page shows a feed of Story insights from the last 14 days. As with standard posts, however, you can filter through these by metric or time period (though 14 days back is the farthest these insights will cover).</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1654 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-stories-filter.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Filtering story posts" width="440" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-stories-filter.png 440w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-stories-filter-165x300.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Unlike a typical Instagram post, Story engagements can also be measured by the number of viewers that who viewed your next story, who tapped back to view a previous story, who swiped over to view the next user&#8217;s story, or who exited from the feature altogether.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1656 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagements.png" alt="Analytics tools for Instagram - Story insights" width="430" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagements.png 430w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagements-161x300.png 161w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<p>These can help you determine how engaging your Story content is, and material that may have lost audience attention.</p>
<h3>Website Traffic</h3>
<p>Since the advent of Shopping on Instagram, consumer experience on the platform has never been more convenient. Now, store profiles can add product stickers right onto their Stories or posts. When tapped, these tags direct the viewer to the appropriate landing page on the brand&#8217;s official website.</p>
<div id="attachment_1673" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1673" class="size-full wp-image-1673" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shopping-stickers-instagram-post-welovecolorscosplay.png" alt="@welovecolorscosplay - Shopping stickers on Instagram posts" width="483" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shopping-stickers-instagram-post-welovecolorscosplay.png 483w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shopping-stickers-instagram-post-welovecolorscosplay-181x300.png 181w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1673" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of welovecolorscosplay (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>If your goal on Instagram is converting customers and boosting sales, you&#8217;d want to ensure your content does just that.<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Viewing insights for your shoppable content is as easy as tapping the &#8220;View Insights&#8221; option on standard posts, and swiping up on a Story to view its engagement data.¬†</span></p>
<p>This can help you determine which posts (and thus, which products) generate the most clickthroughs to your website. In the same vein, it can also identify the products that aren&#8217;t resonating as well with audiences.</p>
<p>Your Instagram Insights also offers basic data on the website traffic driven from your bio URL. Under the &#8220;Interactions&#8221; section, you&#8217;ll find a metric labelled &#8220;Website Clicks&#8221;, along with the corresponding number of website visits drawn from the link in your bio.</p>
<div id="attachment_1672" style="width: 1134px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1672" class="size-full wp-image-1672" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later.jpeg" alt="Instagram analytics - website clicks (Later)" width="1124" height="1978" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later.jpeg 1124w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later-170x300.jpeg 170w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later-768x1352.jpeg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later-582x1024.jpeg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 1124px) 100vw, 1124px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1672" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for an Instagram growth hack? We&#8217;ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Growth hacking is more than just a marketing buzzword. A growth hacker is someone who knows how to use low-cost, creative strategies to help businesses acquire and retain their customers.</p>
<p>In other words, growth hacking puts you in front of the right customers and makes sure that you have what it takes to maintain their attention.</p>
<p>Instagram now has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2018/06/25/how-instagram-is-eating-the-world/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1 billion users worldwide</a>, so it&#8217;s safe to say that it has a lot of opportunities to offer when it comes to helping you connect with your audience.</p>
<p>However, if you want to make the most out of your social campaigns with Instagram, you need to do a lot more than just post regular pictures of your lunch, or your cat.</p>
<p>Here, we&#8217;re going to show you how you can use growth hack tactics to transform your Instagram presence and gain more followers.</p>
<p>Get ready for some serious Instagram growth.</p>
<h2>Instagram Hack 1: Start by Optimizing your Profile</h2>
<p>Your content might be the heart of your Instagram campaign, but your profile is how your customers build a relationship with your brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.instagram.com/270451426423510" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Optimizing your account</a> is probably the most essential Instagram growth hack there is. It ensures that you earn the attention of search engines with keywords, drives people back to your website with valuable links, and generate ongoing interest in your company.</p>
<p>So, how do you start improving your profile?</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a memorable user handle: Your @Name needs to be something your followers will remember, like your business name.</li>
<li>Use keywords in your business name: The name that shows at the top of your profile is a great place to improve your SEO rankings. For instance, instead of Cathy&#8217;s Kit, make it Cathy&#8217;s Kit Clothes.</li>
<li>Engage your audience: Use emojis to interact with your audience on their level.</li>
<li>Include relevant hashtags: Remember to get your customers talking about your brand with proper tags and branded hashtags.</li>
<li>Use @Mentions to link to other accounts: Spread your social presence by linking to other profiles on Instagram with @Mentions</li>
<li>Make the most of business features: Use contact buttons to give your followers numerous ways that they can reach you.</li>
<li>Pick the right profile picture: If you&#8217;re a corporation, a logo should be fine. If you&#8217;re a person, stick to a picture of you smiling!</li>
<li>Implement highlights: Give your followers more information and enhance your profile with Highlights sharing customer stories, Insider tips and other useful content.</li>
<li>Use your link wisely: You only get one link in your bio from Instagram, so make sure that you use it to drive the right attention to the right places.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instagram Hack 2: Improve Your Aesthetics</h2>
<p>If you want to become an Instagram growth hack expert, you need to learn how to make the most of visuals. More than any other digital platform, Instagram is all about images. Your followers will expect to see stunning photos, videos, and slideshows from your company. That means that while your smartphone might give you an efficient way to stock up on material, it might not deliver the professional results you need.</p>
<p>To enhance your Instagram aesthetics, consider learning how to upload your <a href="https://upleap.com/blog/how-to-upload-to-instagram-from-pc-or-mac-computers/" data-wpel-link="internal">content to Instagram from your PC or Mac</a> so that you can use a DSLR camera instead. Alternatively, if you&#8217;re limited with the kind of photos you can take, you can always upgrade your image by using an app like VSCO, the Adobe Photoshop app, or even Canva. All of these tools will let you edit and enhance your photos to give them a better finish.</p>
<p>Remember, themes rule on Instagram, so keep your photos on brand by using the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts: No more than 3 or 4</li>
<li>Colors: Stick to your brand colors where you can</li>
<li>Filters: Don&#8217;t go overboard with these</li>
</ul>
<p>You can even plan out your Instagram grid in advance to make sure that it looks incredible. Look at how Sprout Social uses consistent editing, colors, and themes in their content for a more cohesive profile:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1847" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-insta.jpg" alt="sprout social Instagram hack" width="733" height="593" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-insta.jpg 733w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-insta-300x243.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" /></p>
<h2>Instagram Hack 3: Curate More User-Generated Content</h2>
<p>Want to go viral with your Instagram growth?</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, it&#8217;s not your own content that&#8217;s going to get you there &#8211; it&#8217;s the content that your audience produces on your behalf.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s customers are <a href="https://keenpac.com/e-commerce-brand-packaging" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">far more likely to purchase</a> from brands that are recommended by their peers. If you can convince your audience to do some of your marketing for you, then you&#8217;ll see your presence grow in no time.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to encourage user-generated content from your audience is to include a branded hashtag on your Instagram bio. @Aerie convince their customers to get involved with user-generated content by asking them to use the #AerieREAL tag to empower more women to love themselves. That&#8217;s a fantastic and emotional reason for customers to get sharing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1846" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aerie.jpg" alt="Aerie instagram profile" width="732" height="350" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aerie.jpg 732w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/aerie-300x143.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /></p>
<p>The fact that Aerie put a story behind their request for user-generated content, meant that they&#8217;ve been able to gain countless pieces of material from their audience. They have over 197,000 photos and counting:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1845" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airiereal.jpg" alt="#Aeriereal screenshot" width="772" height="436" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airiereal.jpg 772w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airiereal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Airiereal-768x434.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re having a hard time convincing your audience to use your branded tag, try bribing them with the promise of a gift. A competition that asks users to share them using your product, combined with a branded hashtag can generate plenty of UGC in no time!</p>
<h2>Instagram Hack 4: Interact with Influencers</h2>
<p>User-generated content is great. However, if you want to take advantage of that Instagram growth hack, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that you have plenty of followers to connect with first. When you&#8217;re just starting on Instagram, it can be challenging to build an effective presence alone. Influencers are how you give your brand a much-needed launching pad into the niche or industry you want to connect with.</p>
<p>According to BigCommerce, in 2019, <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.co.uk/blog/influencer-marketing-statistics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">19% of marketers</a> are spending an average of between $1,000 and $10,000 on influencer marketing. What&#8217;s more, another 18% of marketers say that they&#8217;re spending up to $500,000 per year on influencers. That&#8217;s a serious amount of cash.</p>
<p>So, do you need to spend a fortune on Influencers to get Instagram growth?</p>
<p>Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Micro-influencers can be just as effective as their more costly counterparts. That&#8217;s because people generally feel that micro-influencers produce more raw and authentic material. Additionally, these smaller influencers are more likely to engage with their audience than big celebrities. The key to success is finding someone who has a genuine connection with the customers you want to reach. If you need help finding an influencer, try a <a href="https://hyprbrands.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">tool like HYPR</a>. It&#8217;s free for the first 100 searches.</p>
<h2>Instagram Hack 4: Use Your Hashtags Wisely</h2>
<p>Hashtags are some of the most valuable tools you&#8217;ll have in any Instagram growth strategy.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not there to tell your audience what your post is about. Hashtags also improve the visibility of your profile to an incredible extent, helping you to reach new customers from all over the world. However, you do need to learn how to use these tools effectively if you want to make the most out of them. For instance, it&#8217;s not enough to just use popular tags like #TBT or #InstaGood on every post; you&#8217;ll also need to get creative.</p>
<p><a href="https://kenji.ai" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji.AI</a> and other advanced hashtag solutions will help you to find niche hashtags that are more likely to capture the attention of your target audience. Remember, Instagram posts with even one hashtag improve <a href="http://get.simplymeasured.com/rs/simplymeasured2/images/InstagramStudy2014Q3.pdf?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRolua%252FAZKXonjHpfsX57%252BwtX6a2lMI%252F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4CTsViI%252BSLDwEYGJlv6SgFQrDEMal41bgNWRM%253D" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">engagement by 12.6%.</a> To make the most out of your hashtags:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to use location tags to get involved with your local community</li>
<li>Use plenty of tags in each post &#8211; interactions are highest on <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-scientific-guide-to-hashtags-which-ones-work-when-and-how-many" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">content with 11 or more tags</a>.</li>
<li>Mix it up: Don&#8217;t use the same hashtags every time, or Instagram could penalize you for being too &#8220;spammy.&#8221;</li>
<li>Go niche: Don&#8217;t just compete for #CutePuppies, try #CutePugsOnly instead:</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1844" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cutepugsonly.jpg" alt="Cutepugsonly Instagram" width="770" height="445" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cutepugsonly.jpg 770w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cutepugsonly-300x173.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cutepugsonly-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /></p>
<p>If you have your own branded hashtags, don&#8217;t forget to encourage your users to follow them and share them with friends too! This will help to drive more attention back to your Instagram profile.</p>
<h2>Instagram Hack 5: Discover the Value of Video</h2>
<p>Video is bigger than ever on Instagram today.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rise of Instagram Live for real-time streaming, and IGTV for longer videos from a reputable brand, Instagram is quickly becoming the go-to place for social video. If you haven&#8217;t tried upping your game with a video campaign yet, you could be missing out.</p>
<p>According to statistics, <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/blog/state-of-content-marketing-2012" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">87% of marketers</a> are currently investing in video, and the number keeps growing. Fortunately for Instagram users, it&#8217;s easy to get started with a video strategy. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share limited-time videos on Instagram Stories: Stories is a great place to launch your video strategy if you&#8217;re still new to the format. Because your videos only stick around for 24 hours, they&#8217;re not going to haunt you for too long if they don&#8217;t have the right impact on your audience. If you do end up with a great video, you can always save it to your Highlights so that your customers can come back to it.</li>
<li>IGTV: If you&#8217;ve been experimenting with video for a while now, and you think you&#8217;re ready to take it to the next level, an IGTV account can help your business to grow at an incredible pace. Netflix receives millions of viewers for the content that it publishes on Instagram&#8217;s IGTV platform. Because IGTV gives you more time to work with than a standard video, it also means that you can share more information too.</li>
<li>Instagram Live: Need to connect with your audience in a more intimate way? Instagram Live is the ideal way to do that. With a Live video, you can create an authentic relationship with your audience through Q&amp;A sessions, webinars, How-to videos, and more. It&#8217;s also a great way to take your customers behind the scenes of your brand.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1843" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/netflix-video.jpg" alt="Netflix IGTV example" width="717" height="494" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/netflix-video.jpg 717w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/netflix-video-300x207.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px" /></p>

<h2>Instagram Hack 6: Get Some Professional Assistance</h2>
<p>Hacking your Instagram efforts isn&#8217;t easy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s always room for better engagement.</p>
<p>In the slew of tips regarding hashtag strategies, ad placements, and reliance on marketing services; one method remains completely free and easy to implement: knowing the best time to post on Instagram.</p>
<p>With enough research and insight into your current audience activity, you can quickly discover the optimum times and days of the week to upload your Instagram content. These are timeframes in which your existing (and potential!) followers are more active &#8211; the times that garner you most interaction and engagement.</p>
<p>So, what are the best times to post on Instagram? Using intensive studies, we break these down in the following sections &#8211; but first&#8230;</p>
<h2>What are Your Instagram Metrics?</h2>
<p>Instagram metrics are the standards you use to measure your profile performance. While these differ depending on your business goals and industry, we&#8217;ll take a look at three important metrics below: engagement rate, follower growth, and optimum posting times.</p>
<h3>Engagement Rate</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2020" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-engagement-rate.png" alt="Instagram Insights - engagement rate" width="1000" height="478" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-engagement-rate.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-engagement-rate-300x143.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-engagement-rate-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Your engagement rate refers to how well your audience responds to the content you post. You can track your overall engagement rate to determine the interactions on your profile over time; or monitor your engagement rates per post to see which types of content resonate with your audience best.</p>
<h3>Follower Growth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2021" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-follower-growth.png" alt="Instagram Insights - follower growth rate" width="1000" height="319" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-follower-growth.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-follower-growth-300x96.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-metric-follower-growth-768x245.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Follower growth refers to your audience growth over time. This is an essential metric to track when building an Instagram brand; as continuous growth shows you&#8217;re doing something right. On the other hand, drop-offs in your follower count may point to poor practices in your content or marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Either way, keeping an eye on your follower growth (and the factors that influence it) can helps you set your profile on the right track.</p>
<h3>Optimal Posting Times</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2022" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-optimal-post-times.jpg" alt="Woman looking at smartphone" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-optimal-post-times.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-optimal-post-times-300x165.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-when-to-post-instagram-optimal-post-times-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The best times to post on Instagram are the days &#8211; and times in the day &#8211; during which your target audience is most active and engaged.</p>
<p>Keeping track of your optimal posting times is thus mandatory for <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/post-on-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">boosting your engagement rate</a> (and potentially, your follower growth in turn).</p>
<p>These times will vary depending on the niche and location of a target audience, so it&#8217;s important to do your own research. And while it doesn&#8217;t necessarily¬†<em>guarantee¬†</em>you that instant engagement; it&#8217;s a great starting point for increasing your reach.</p>
<p>So, how do you determine your best times to post on Instagram?</p>
<h2>Using Instagram Insights</h2>
<p>The most basic, accessible tool at your disposal is the native app feature, &#8220;<a href="https://help.instagram.com/1533933820244654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Instagram Insights</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This data is exclusively available to those with a business account; so if you haven&#8217;t made the switch already (especially if you&#8217;re an aspiring brand) do so now!</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-87 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-switch-to-business-account.png" alt="Switching from personal to business account" width="440" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-switch-to-business-account.png 440w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-switch-to-business-account-165x300.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Your insights are accessed through your account menu under &#8220;Archive&#8221;. Tapping this button will lead you to an informative overview of your content performance, profile activity, and audience data.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1027 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-insights.png" alt="Instagram Insights" width="500" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-insights.png 500w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-insights-188x300.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>To determine your best times to post on Instagram, hop on over to the &#8220;Audience&#8221; tab. This section displays all the pertinent statistics on your followers and most engaged types of users.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1658 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age.png" alt="Instagram metrics - Audience insights" width="480" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age.png 480w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>The data shown includes your top-engaged locations, age range, gender &#8211; and the¬†<strong>specific days and hours your audience is most active.¬†</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1676" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times.jpg" alt="Instagram - best engagement times" width="1000" height="706" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times-300x212.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-best-engagement-times-768x542.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Needless to say, this is what you&#8217;ll want to focus on when deciding your optimal posting times. Though the data is quite surface-level, it&#8217;s a great place to start.</p>
<h2>Experimenting With Your Best Times</h2>
<p>Another easy way to find your best posting times is to simply¬†<strong>experiment.</strong></p>
<p>This may involve a bit more research and patience (plus a spreadsheet or two!); though considering how optimal post times are dependent on each, exclusive user, it could be well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Testing your best times needn&#8217;t be a complex process &#8211; it can be as simple as having a different posting time for each day of the week (this would require a new Instagram post every day!).</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve experimented with each posting time for each day, compare the amount of interactions you&#8217;ve received on each day/time.</p>

<p>This will not only determine your best-performing day of the week¬†<em>and¬†</em>the optimum posting time for that day; but your most engaged times for each separate day of the week.</p>
<h2>Best Time to Post on Instagram &#8211; General Guidelines</h2>
<p>Though these strategies are valuable methods of finding your optimal post times, below are additional factors to consider.</p>
<h3>When to Post on Instagram &#8211; Consider the Time Zone</h3>
<p>As helpful of a tool as Instagram Insights is, it offers the average data on your audience across¬†<em>all¬†</em>their locations.</p>
<p>While valuable for brands attempting to reach a broad scope of followers, those targeting a specific, geographical region may find these statistics a tad wonky.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2019 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-instagram-insights-top-locations.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Top Locations" width="478" height="323" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-instagram-insights-top-locations.png 478w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-instagram-insights-top-locations-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>When deciding your optimal post times, take your target audience&#8217;s location into account. Make sure you strategize your times around¬†<em>their¬†</em>specific time zone, even if it isn&#8217;t your own.</p>
<p>Determining your most engaged audience times based on location can be achieved through third-party apps, as we&#8217;ll discuss below. If your Instagram Insights already reveal your target location as your most engaged source of users; the data they provide on your most engaged audience times can be a helpful (if slightly inaccurate) starting point.</p>
<h3>When to Post on Instagram ‚Äì Off-Work Hours</h3>
<p>Analytics aside, a simple factor to consider when determining your best posting times is when your audience is likely off work or school hours.</p>
<p>These typically take place around the 5 to 9 pm timeframe, or the mornings just before work around 7 to 9 am. Be sure to take lunches into account too, as those on their breaks will likely be scrolling through their Instagram feeds to pass the time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2030" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-off-office-hours.jpg" alt="When to post on Instagram - Off-work hours" width="1000" height="548" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-off-office-hours.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-off-office-hours-300x164.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-off-office-hours-768x421.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>While you can look into detailed statistics for better accuracy, plenty chalk this up to common sense or educated guesses. Think about it; when are¬†<em>you </em>most likely to browse through Instagram?</p>
<h3>¬†When to Post on Instagram &#8211; Consider the Industry</h3>
<p>Not only will your optimum posting times differ by location &#8211; they can also vary by industry.</p>
<p>Research shows that specific sectors vary considerably in their best¬† (average) Instagram post times, so be sure to take¬†<em>your¬†</em>industry&#8217;s statistics into account.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2029" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-industry.jpg" alt="Best times to post on Instagram - Consider the industry" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-industry.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-industry-300x165.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/when-to-post-on-instagram-industry-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Sprout Social took time to research on the best posting times among retail, media, technology, educational, healthcare, and non-profit organizations. The results were quite diverse:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong>(Best Posting Time for) Retail Companies: </strong>3 pm on Wednesdays</li>
<li><strong>Media Companies: </strong>9 am on Fridays</li>
<li><strong>Tech Companies: </strong>6 am and 9¬†am on Wednesdays</li>
<li><strong>Education Companies: </strong>10 am on Fridays</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Companies: </strong>8 am on Tuesdays</li>
<li><strong>Non-Profit Companies: </strong>2 pm on Wednesdays</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, their reports hadn&#8217;t covered <em>all¬†</em>industries. If it&#8217;s absent in the list above, it&#8217;s worth looking through available statistics on¬†<em>your¬†</em>specific niche.</p>
<h3>When to Post on Instagram &#8211; Use Third-Party Apps</h3>
<p>Going at this research alone can be quite daunting, especially if you&#8217;re new to the Instagram platform.</p>
<p>To save the extra time and effort, you can always turn to third-party apps that do all the heavy-lifting for you. These tools provide detailed statistics on your profile activity, the engagement it receives, and your target audiences &#8211; helping you tailor your content and marketing strategy as necessary. This, of course, includes data on your best times to post for Instagram.</p>
<p>Below, we discuss the top three tools that offer this information.</p>
<h4>Later</h4>
<p>Though best-known for their third-party Instagram scheduler, Later offers a wide variety of analytical tools for boosting your content engagement and follower growth.</p>
<p>Users can uncover their optimal posting times by using their &#8220;Best Time to Post&#8221; feature. This tool automatically calculates your <strong>top seven¬†</strong>posting times that garner the most engagement.</p>
<div id="attachment_2024" style="width: 1113px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2024" class="size-full wp-image-2024" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/later-best-times-to-post-on-instagram.png" alt="Later - Best times to post on Instagram" width="1103" height="624" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/later-best-times-to-post-on-instagram.png 1103w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/later-best-times-to-post-on-instagram-300x170.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/later-best-times-to-post-on-instagram-768x434.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/later-best-times-to-post-on-instagram-1024x579.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1103px) 100vw, 1103px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2024" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>
<p>You can additionally check when your audience is most active on the app along with your top time zones to ensure accurate location targeting.</p>
<p>This data can then be used hand-in-hand with Later&#8217;s Instagram scheduler &#8211; an online content calendar that directly publishes to your feed, according to a set date and time.</p>
<div id="attachment_175" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175" class="size-full wp-image-175" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview.png" alt="Visual planning with Later" width="1000" height="476" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview-300x143.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-175" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>
<p>These is especially helpful for those living in a different time zone to their target audience. You may find your audience most active during hours when you&#8217;re not available; for example, Australian brands targeting American users may find their potential followers most engaged during early morning Australian hours (such as 12 or 3 am).</p>
<p>Through Later&#8217;s scheduler, however &#8211; users have the ease of preparing their posts for automatic publishing at their best-performing times.</p>
<h4>Iconosquare</h4>
<p>Iconosquare offers Instagram users detailed reports on all important performance metrics &#8211; including engagement rate, follower growth, reach, impressions, and hashtag growth rate.</p>
<p>The platform also offers an in-depth overview of when most of your followers are online, and the specific times your receive the highest engagement.</p>
<p>A perk to using Iconosquare are the visual charts they use in displaying such data &#8211; keeping information simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>For example, your audience&#8217;s most active times are displayed through a color-coded graph with an hourly breakdown for each day of the week.</p>
<div id="attachment_2018" style="width: 1305px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2018" class="size-full wp-image-2018" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-best-engagement-times-iconosquare.png" alt="Iconosquare - Best engagement times" width="1295" height="420" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-best-engagement-times-iconosquare.png 1295w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-best-engagement-times-iconosquare-300x97.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-best-engagement-times-iconosquare-768x249.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/best-times-to-post-on-instagram-best-engagement-times-iconosquare-1024x332.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1295px) 100vw, 1295px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2018" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Iconosquare.</p></div>

<p>Iconosquare has a separate chart for¬†<strong>most engaged times, </strong>and follow a similar visual concept, as seen below.</p>
<div id="attachment_1648" style="width: 1289px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1648" class="size-full wp-image-1648" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-story-engagement.png" alt="Iconosquare - Instagram story engagement" width="1279" height="469" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-story-engagement.png 1279w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-story-engagement-300x110.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-story-engagement-768x282.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-story-engagement-1024x375.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1279px) 100vw, 1279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1648" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Iconosquare.</p></div>
<p>Your best time to post within the week is instantly marked by a symbol amongst the rest of the data.</p>
<p>These reports are clear representations of your audience statistics, and help you grasp important information right off the bat.</p>
<p>Similarly to Later, Iconosquare also provides a third-party Instagram scheduler; letting you easily schedule your posts according to the data they provide.</p>
<div id="attachment_2023" style="width: 1372px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2023" class="size-full wp-image-2023" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iconosquare-scheduler.png" alt="Iconosquare scheduler" width="1362" height="569" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iconosquare-scheduler.png 1362w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iconosquare-scheduler-300x125.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iconosquare-scheduler-768x321.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iconosquare-scheduler-1024x428.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1362px) 100vw, 1362px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2023" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Iconosquare.</p></div>

<div id="attachment_2026" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2026" class="size-full wp-image-2026" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-viralpost.png" alt="Sprout Social - Viralpost" width="1000" height="458" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-viralpost.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-viralpost-300x137.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-viralpost-768x352.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2026" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy Sprout Social.</p></div>

<h2 id="ritekit-alerts">Best Global Times to Post on Instagram</h2>
<p>Sprout Social has also covered the best times to post on Instagram across most brand niches. For those curious, here&#8217;s what they found:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Best general times¬†</strong>to post on Instagram: 11 am on Wednesdays and 10-11 am on Fridays</li>
<li><strong>The best day </strong>to post on Instagram: Wednesdays</li>
<li><strong>The worst day </strong>to post on Instagram: Sundays &#8211; they tend to garner the least engagement</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_2025" style="width: 790px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2025" class="size-full wp-image-2025" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-instagram-global-engagement.png" alt="Sprout Social - Global Engagement times" width="780" height="546" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-instagram-global-engagement.png 780w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-instagram-global-engagement-300x210.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sprout-social-instagram-global-engagement-768x538.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2025" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Sprout Social.</p></div>
<p>To maintain consistent engagement throughout the week, Sprout Social recommends users to post from Tuesday through Friday, within the 10 am to 3 pm timeframe.</p>
<p>As for lowest overall engagement, users are advised to steer clear of late night or early morning postings from 11 pm to 3 am.</p>
<p>In general, the most opportune posting times seem to peak both mid-day and mid-week, though users may want to experiment around this. After all, their audience may be sifting through their Instagram feeds first thing in the morning or just before hitting the hay &#8211; possibly leaving few opportunities for engagement in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>Statistics also show that weekends may not be an optimal time for posting; though again, this could depend on your niche &#8211; so be sure to test the waters!</p>
<h2>Maximize Your Best Posting Times</h2>
<p>An effective Instagram strategy needn&#8217;t revolve around expensive ads, laborious marketing, and shady services that cheat the algorithm (ultimately leading to a shadowban). Sometimes all it takes is knowing¬†<em>when¬†</em>to post.</p>
<p>By optimizing your audience&#8217;s most active times on the platform, you can easily turn any poor engagement around. With a bit of research and metric tracking, you&#8217;ll uncover the best times to post Instagram to boost your growth on the app.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wish you knew how to download your favorite Instagram photos, videos, and stories?</p>
<p>Millions of photos, videos, and stories are uploaded to Instagram every day. The chances are that when you&#8217;re scrolling through all that content, you&#8217;ll eventually find something that you want to save.</p>
<p>After all, liking or commenting a post is great, but what if you want to check out that content again later? <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-pc/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Screenshotting your phone</a> rarely gives you the quality image you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll see a video that really inspires you and decide that you want to keep it around for later. Perhaps you&#8217;ll find a photo from an influencer that you want to regram (with their permission of course). Whatever the reason, we&#8217;ve put together this guide to help you download Instagram videos, photos, and Stories &#8217;til your heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<h2>How to Download Instagram Photos and videos</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the bread and butter of Instagram &#8211; photos.</p>
<p>Instagram is packed full of beautiful images that are sure to inspire, motivate, and amaze you.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a snapshot of a cute puppy that fills your heart with joy, or a makeup idea that you don&#8217;t want to forget about, there are plenty of reasons why you might want to download Instagram photos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Instagram doesn&#8217;t make this process simple. There&#8217;s no &#8220;save photo&#8221; option at the bottom of your page. That&#8217;s because Instagram wants to avoid copyright issues as much as possible. Before you download anything on Instagram, it&#8217;s best to <a href="https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">double-check the company&#8217;s copyright rules</a> &#8211; just in case. Additionally, remember that you always have to get a user&#8217;s permission before you repost anything that you download.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, here are a few easy ways to download Instagram photos:</p>
<h2>1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Bookmark your favorite pics and videos</h2>
<p>One of the easiest ways to download an Instagram post without a screenshot is to track your favorite posts using Instagram bookmarks. Designed to help people rediscover the content that they love, the bookmark feature allows <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1744643532522513" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">you to tap the bookmark icon</a> at the bottom of any post to save it to a &#8220;collection.&#8221; You can create separate collections for different content. You might have one collection named &#8220;Cute Puppies&#8221; and another one called &#8220;Makeup ideas&#8221; for instance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2103" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maybelline.jpg" alt="Bookmark Instagram photo" width="688" height="1024" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maybelline.jpg 688w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/maybelline-202x300.jpg 202w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></p>
<p>You won&#8217;t have the photo on your camera roll this way, but you will be able to revisit it later without returning to the original poster&#8217;s account and browsing through all of their content.</p>
<p>To visit your collections, tap on the three horizontal lines in the corner of your Instagram profile, and click on the bookmark icon. Here, you can organize and check out all the images that you&#8217;ve saved for later. Easy peasy.</p>
<h2>2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Save Your Photos Automatically</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re not worried about saving other people&#8217;s content on Instagram, but you want to make sure that you have a backup of any of the material that you create on the Instagram app, then read on.</p>
<p>Taking a photo or video within the Instagram app is a great way to make sure that you&#8217;re taking full advantage of the filters and tools that Instagram offers. Additionally, if you want to give your users a complete and authentic experience, you can use things like Instagram video to create an original vertical video. The only problem is figuring out how to download Instagram videos when you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by clicking on the profile section in your Instagram account, you can set your app to automatically save anything you create in Instagram, to your camera roll.</p>
<p>Within the Settings section, click on Original photos, then toggle the button next to &#8220;Save Original Photos&#8221;. This asks the Instagram app to save any videos or photos that you take in Instagram, so you always have an extra backup. This feature is fantastic for companies that want to cross-promote their content across multiple platforms too!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2104" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/save-original-photos-option.jpg" alt="save photos" width="585" height="250" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/save-original-photos-option.jpg 585w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/save-original-photos-option-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /></p>
<h2>3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Save other people&#8217;s photos to your camera roll</h2>
<p>If you want to save other people&#8217;s content to your camera roll so you can regram it with their permission, or use it as inspiration later, then things start to get a little trickier. There&#8217;s no native option to download Instagram videos or photos within the app.</p>
<p>Instagram claims that they&#8217;ve failed to provide this service to protect copyrights. However, we all know that some companies love having their images re-grammed by customers and followers in the right circumstances. If you do have permission to download and use another person&#8217;s content, then you can use the following workaround to collect their content.</p>
<p>On your smartphone, log into the Instagram app and find the photo you want to save, then click on the &#8220;‚Ä¶&#8221; option in the corner of the post. This will give you the opportunity to copy the link to the image. You&#8217;ll then be able to paste that link into your smartphone browser.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2105" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Copy-link.jpg" alt="Copy link for Instagram photos" width="730" height="541" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Copy-link.jpg 730w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Copy-link-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p>The link will take you to a new version of the image that you want to save, where you can hold your finger over the picture until you get the option to &#8220;Copy&#8221; the photo. From there, all you need to do is open your notes app and paste the image into a new record. Tap on the &#8220;Share&#8221; option and click on Save image to move the picture over to your camera roll.</p>
<p>Though this is a helpful workaround for people who want to download Instagram photos, there are a couple of problems with it. First, it&#8217;s pretty clunky and slow as image-saving goes. Secondly, you can only save images this way &#8211; not videos.</p>
<h2>4.¬†¬†¬†¬† Try a Third-Party App</h2>
<p>If you find the process of downloading images into your notes too exhausting &#8211; or you want to download Instagram videos as well as pictures, then your best bet might be to choose a third-party app. Just make sure that you do your research on any app you&#8217;re considering before you use it. You don&#8217;t want to give your details to any shady companies.</p>
<p>One pretty straightforward option is to <a href="https://downloadinstagramvideos.net/en/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">use the &#8220;DownloadInstagramvideos.net&#8221; app</a>. The good thing about this tool is that there&#8217;s no software to download, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about ending up with a virus on your device.</p>
<p>To download Instagram videos with this tool, go to Instagram, and open the video you want to download. Click on the three dots again &#8220;‚Ä¶&#8221; to get your options menu up and click on the &#8220;Share¬† URL&#8221; or &#8220;Copy URL&#8221; link. You can also open the video in a new tab on your web browser to get an URL that way.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2106" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-videos.png" alt="Download instagram videos app" width="803" height="346" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-videos.png 803w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-videos-300x129.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-videos-768x331.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></p>
<p>Go back to the DownloadInstagramVideos.net website and paste your URL into the available input box, then click on Download Instagram Video.</p>
<p>Tada! You can now save the video to your computer or device. Easy peasy.</p>
<h2>How to Download Instagram Stories</h2>
<p>Saving Instagram pictures and videos are pretty simple these days. There are plenty of people out there who have figured out basic workarounds that you can use, like the ones that we&#8217;ve mentioned above. However, understanding how to download Instagram Stories is a bit tougher.</p>
<p>Instagram Stories are neither a video nor a picture &#8211; they&#8217;re kind of a combination of both. What&#8217;s more, they disappear after 24 hours, which means that if you&#8217;re not quick to save them, you might never see the content again.</p>
<p>So, how do you download Instagram Stories?</p>
<h2>1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Archive your own content for later use</h2>
<p>If you want to keep your own Instagram Stories around for later, then you can archive all the content you create within the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Start by going to your Instagram profile, and into the &#8220;Settings&#8221; section. Click on &#8220;Story Settings,&#8221; and toggle the button marked &#8220;Save to Archive&#8221;. This will automatically preserve all the stories that you create in case you want to use them again.</p>
<p>If you click on the Archive icon in your settings in the future, you&#8217;ll be able to see all of the Stories you&#8217;ve created since you switched this setting on. The Stories are sorted by date to make it easier for you to find the right content.</p>
<h2>2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Save Stories in your Highlights</h2>
<p>Another way to make sure that your Instagram Stories don&#8217;t just disappear is to save them in your &#8220;Highlights&#8221; section. This is one of the more recent upgrades to appear to Instagram Stories. Basically, it lets you <a href="https://embedsocial.com/blog/instagram-highlights" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">create Highlight sections</a> on your Instagram profile that shows off the previous material that you&#8217;ve created.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2107" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Instagram-highlights.jpg" alt="Instagram highlights" width="800" height="558" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Instagram-highlights.jpg 800w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Instagram-highlights-300x209.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Instagram-highlights-768x536.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Highlights are an excellent way to add extra value to your profile. You can use them to answer customer questions with an FAQ section, highlight crucial customer testimonials for social proof, or draw attention to new products and promotions.</p>
<p>Stories saved to your Instagram highlights also remain on your profile for as long as you want them to. If you want to save your Story to a highlight, just click on the &#8220;Highlight&#8221; button at the bottom of the page when you&#8217;re creating your new story. This will allow you to save your content either to an existing highlight, or a new one.</p>
<h2>3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Save Instagram Stories with a Third-Party App</h2>
<p>If you want to save another person&#8217;s Instagram Stories, then things get trickier again. However, it&#8217;s not impossible to keep someone else&#8217;s story &#8211; just tough. Your best option when it comes to downloading Instagram stories is to use a third-party <a href="https://embedsocial.com/products/embedstories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">application like EmbedStories</a>.</p>
<p>This is a service specifically designed for people who want to curate and use Instagram Stories with the permission of other creators. With this app, you can save all the unique elements of the Instagram Story, including videos and photos separately, so that you can use the elements that you need and discard the rest.</p>
<p>EmbedStories also allows you to create the code you need to <a href="https://embedsocial.com/blog/embed-instagram-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">embed the Stories</a> you create on Instagram into any other website. That&#8217;s great if you&#8217;ve designed some useful stories on Instagram that you want to take into your website or blog.</p>
<h2>How to Download All of Your Content on Instagram</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in saving all of the content that you&#8217;ve ever shared on Instagram &#8211; we have some good news for you. The social media platform recently made it much easier to access all your historical material in one go. First announced in 2018, this Instagram download feature works on desktop devices, smartphones, and tablets alike.</p>
<p>All you need to do is go to Instagram.com &#8211; the website and log in with your password and username. From there, click on the gear icon next to the &#8220;Edit Profile&#8221; section to bring up the pop-up menu. Click on Privacy and Security and scroll down until you see an option for &#8220;Data Download.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2108" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-content.jpg" alt="Download Instagram content " width="1200" height="671" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-content.jpg 1200w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-content-300x168.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-content-768x429.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download-instagram-content-1024x573.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>Here, you can request a copy of everything that you&#8217;ve ever shared on Instagram, including videos, Stories, photos, and even comments. Since Instagram needs to create a massive file of all the material you&#8217;ve posted online, you might not get an email in your inbox immediately &#8211; but be patient, it will turn up eventually.</p>
<p>This is the easiest way to make sure that you have a backup of all the information you&#8217;ve posted on Instagram, in case you ever want to use any of your content elsewhere online.</p>
<p>Obviously, this feature only works for content that you&#8217;ve shared yourself, so you can&#8217;t use it to download other people&#8217;s content. However, this option is very useful if you want to make sure that you have a backup of your visual marketing tools.</p>
<h2>Downloading Content on Instagram</h2>
<p>Downloading photos, videos, and Stories on Instagram isn&#8217;t easy &#8211; even if you want to save the content you&#8217;ve posted in the past. Fortunately, there are ways that you can get your hands on the material that you need. From workarounds to third-party apps, the options above will ensure that you can tap into all of the fantastic sources of inspiration and motivation available on Insta.</p>
