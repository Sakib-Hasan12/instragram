								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;re looking for a tool that can increase your audience on Instagram and you came across Stim Social.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering if Stim Social is worth it. Does it really work? Is it safe? Does it include any unique features?</p>
<p>To save you the hassle of trying out the tool, I made an account, linked it to a test Instagram profile, and played around with it for a few days.</p>
<p>In this Stim Social review, I&#8217;ll share my experience with you. When you&#8217;re done, you&#8217;ll know exactly what to expect from this tool.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start.</p>
<h2>What is Stim Social?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1732 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="355" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks.jpg 966w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks-300x212.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>There are many different types of Instagram automation tools, such as full-on bots, tools that only perform one action, and ones that link you with social media marketers. Where does Stim Social fit in?</p>
<p>Stim Social is an Instagram bot but it only automates a handful of tasks. One of the headlines on their website promises to send real, active, and engaged followers to your Instagram.</p>
<p>It can automate the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow</li>
<li>Unfollow</li>
<li>Like (called Engagement Like on their platform)</li>
</ul>
<p>They claim users can rapidly build a legitimate audience on Instagram by automating these three tasks. On top of that, the tool also provides you with detailed analytics, so you can watch your account growth in real-time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what most of these Instagram bots promise. Is Stim Social the one that really works?</p>
<h2>Stim Social&#8217;s Reputation Online</h2>
<p>Bear in mind, Stim Social is not the most popular Instagram tool.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t so many reviews about it online. On the other hand, there is an unclaimed Trust Pilot page that &#8211; unfortunately &#8211; has mostly negative reviews on it. Right now it has 14 reviews, and 86% of them are bad.</p>
<p>Look:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1727 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="208" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot.jpg 859w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot-300x104.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot-768x266.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a great sign. Especially considering most of the user reviews mention similar downsides, which we&#8217;ll discuss in the cons section of this review.</p>
<h2>Stim Social&#8217;s Features</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering if this tool has the features you need to boost your audience growth.</p>
<p>If you visited their webpage, then you have probably noticed they&#8217;re suspiciously vague about the included features. In fact, they&#8217;re vague about the price too.</p>
<p>After playing around with the free trial, I discovered most of the tool&#8217;s features. What it boils down to are three core services: auto-follow, auto unfollow, and engagement likes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t that impressed. Most of the features are the same as found on other bots, and lacking in several ways too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let&#8217;s run through them.</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Auto Follow &amp; Targets</h3>
<p>Most Instagram bots have an auto-follow service, and it&#8217;s a rather basic one at this point. Naturally, to start this service, you&#8217;ll need to add proper targets first. Stim Social has a decent amount of targets.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Competitor Profiles</li>
<li>Hashtags</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Business Accounts</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Private Accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>If you add appropriate targets, the bot shouldn&#8217;t have a problem finding accounts to interact with. Most people report their accounts did grow after using the tool for a few days.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Configuring Interaction Limits</h3>
<p>Most of these limits are set to default values, but you can adjust them as you see fit. Custom limits are available for the main three actions: following, unfollowing, and liking.</p>
<p>Another filter you can add limits to is called Post Limits which only interacts with users who have a certain number of posts.</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Auto Likes</h3>
<p>At the moment, Stim Social likes content in two ways; like a user&#8217;s most recent post, or like content in your profiles feed at random. You can change the liking service in the settings menu.</p>
<p>The liking service works with the other auto services, using the same targets, and leaves a like on profiles it comes across.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind this service isn&#8217;t the highlight of Stim Social&#8217;s service, it&#8217;s more like an add-on.</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Adjust the Speed</h3>
<p>On the dashboard, you&#8217;ll notice you can change the speed of the services. The problem is the faster speeds are behind a paywall. If you want a faster service, then you&#8217;ll have to subscribe to the right plan.</p>
<p>Here are the speeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Turbo</li>
<li>Extreme</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about the subscription plans in the pricing section.</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Detailed Growth Analytics</h3>
<p>One feature that makes this tool stand out from the rest is the detailed reports. There are reports for a couple of things, such as Engagement Reports and Targeting Reports.</p>
<p>These reports show the data you might expect. The engagement report shows the engagement that your last 12 posts receive.</p>
<p>The targeting report can reveal some interesting data. It shows you how each of your individual targets is performing and it also assigns a quality score to the users. The report will also reveal the number of follow-backs you receive, as well as other interactions such as likes and comments.</p>
<h3>6 &#8211; Clean Feed</h3>
<p>Stim Social&#8217;s Clean Feed service is only available on Turbo and Extreme memberships. Essentially, what it does is mute the accounts the tool interacts with on your behalf to keep your Instagram feed clean. It&#8217;s a useful service. You can also choose to unmute the new followers if you want to view their content too.</p>
<h3>7 &#8211; Story Views</h3>
<p>Another automated service that views the stories of specific accounts or accounts with target parameters. Story Views is useful because the creators of those stories can see your account in their list of story views. It&#8217;s another way to send out a &#8220;Ping&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<h2>How Much is Stim Social?</h2>
<p>Stim Social has three main subscription plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast &#8211; $9.95/month</li>
<li>Turbo &#8211; $19.95/month</li>
<li>Extreme &#8211; $29.95/month</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few other add-ons you can choose, such as Engagement Pack and Direct Messages.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1734 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsociasignup.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="482" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsociasignup.jpg 565w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsociasignup-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<h3>What is The Engagement Pack?</h3>
<p>While looking at the prices, you have probably noticed the plans on the pricier end have a service called Engagement Pack. The Engagement Pack adds a new service to the mix, an auto-direct message service, and an additional report, called Top Engagers Report.</p>
<p>The auto direct message service supports up to 10 custom written messages, selected at random. And the Top Engager Report shows who your top fans are, so you can better understand your audience. Overall, a useful package.</p>
<p>P.S. Wondering how to organically <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/post-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">improve your engagement on Instagram?</a></p>
<h2>Stim Social Pros</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re familiar with the features, we&#8217;ll run through our list of pros.</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; 5 Day Free Trial 👍</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice when a tool offers a free trial period. Stim Social offers an entire week of free usage, which is great. No credit card required, and no hidden charges.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Decent Amount of Targets 👍</h3>
<p>You can filter accounts based on the three main channels; competition, hashtags, and location. There are also the minor target filters we mentioned earlier. Overall, an okay amount of filters to work with.</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Simple User Interface 👍</h3>
<p>No need to spend hours configuring individual services and locating the appropriate menus. Stim Social streamlines the user interface to the point where you only need to worry about toggling services. It&#8217;s very easy to use. Very user-friendly!</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Works Online (No Need to Download and Install) 👍</h3>
<p>Another thing I liked about this tool is you don&#8217;t have to download and install any software. The bot runs on their servers. You don&#8217;t have to worry about hosting anything with virtual private servers and whatnot. It makes things very convenient.</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Set Your Own Limits 👍</h3>
<p>Think the bot is creating too much activity? Following too many accounts? Head over to the settings and limit the number of actions it can perform. It&#8217;s nice to have the option to manually change the limits of various services.</p>
<h3>6 &#8211; Good Reporting Tools 👍</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to see watch your profile&#8217;s growth. Stim Social offers a decent number of reporting tools. You can track all kinds of data, from new followers to conversion rates and engagement rates. The add-on Top Engagers report is useful too.</p>
<h2>Stim Social Cons</h2>
<p>On the flip side, here&#8217;s what we didn&#8217;t like:</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Slow Support 👎</h3>
<p>Remember the Trust Pilot ratings from earlier? Most of the people leaving negative reviews for Stim Social mention the support takes a long time to reply to emails.</p>
<p>At the moment, they only offer email support, there&#8217;s no hotline or live-chat service. They do have a support page where you can find basic information about the tool but if you need help with a specific issue, it could be a while before you receive a response.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Not Very Transparent 👎</h3>
<p>On their website, they like to keep things details very vague. Their pricing page isn&#8217;t even public! There&#8217;s no mention of the tool being a bot or any of the auto-services either.</p>
<p>The headlines are: &#8220;Attract New Followers, Drive Site Traffic, Build Your Influence, Increase Product Sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very little information on how they are going to do that. The support page provides more information, but I would prefer not to have to browse through their knowledge base to find basic information that should be on the front page of their website.</p>
<p>You get the impression that the company is trying to hide something from the public. There&#8217;s also no about page!</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Unreliable Performance 👎</h3>
<p>Another common complaint about Stim Social is regarding the performance. Many users claim that the tool worked great up until a certain point, and then it stopped working altogether.</p>
<p>Ironically, it seems like the free trial works better than the paid memberships. There are lots of complaints from people who bought a plan only to discover the bot refused to work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some times people would notice far too much activity on their accounts. It seems like the performance is unreliable and not consistent.</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Can&#8217;t Use Account When Bot is Active 👎</h3>
<p>One thing to remember, that isn&#8217;t clear on their website, is you shouldn&#8217;t interact with your Instagram account when the bot is active.</p>
<p>This is can be a dealbreaker for social media marketers who always need to keep up with direct messages and other actions that this bot doesn&#8217;t automate. But they warn if you use the bot while also connected on your phone, it could lead to a block-out.</p>
<h2>Is Stim Social Worth It?</h2>
<p>To summarize, while Stim Social provides an okay service, it&#8217;s not something we can confidently recommend. I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as other reviewers and call it a straight-up scam. It worked well enough for me. But I feel like there are much better alternatives out there. Stim Social felt like a stripped-down version of other Instagram bots.</p>
<h2>Stim Social Alternatives</h2>
<p>Speaking of alternatives, there are two tools that come to mind.</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1 &#8211; Kenji </a></h3>
<p>Kenji is a really interesting little Instagram bot that is also great for people on a budget. The bot uses machine learning to create a portfolio of activity based on your interactions.</p>
<p>It has plenty of anti-bot detection filters too, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about getting your account blocked from Instagram. Very interesting bot. And it has a free 3-day trial, no credit card required.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">2 &#8211; Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Upleap is a little pricier, but their service is well worth it. The way Upleap works is it links you to social media managers which perform actions on your accounts, based on your requests.</p>
<p>The great thing about Upleap is it&#8217;s not technically a bot. It&#8217;s kind of like putting your account in the hands of a professional social media marketer, so the risk of being blocked is minimal. You can also try it for free for three days.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Stim Social review. I hope this review cleared up some of your questions about the software and helped point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>Using an Instagram bot always comes with a certain level of risk. When it comes to using Instagram bots you need to use common sense and be careful. Make sure the speed settings are low, at least at first, and don&#8217;t spam your account with too many actions.</p>
<p>While Instagram probably won&#8217;t straight up ban you if they find out you&#8217;re using a bot, they&#8217;ll keep asking you to change your password or lock you out, which can be a frustrating experience. Although Instagram bots can save you a lot of time, they are risky, so use at your own risk.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were active in the internet marketing world a couple of years ago, chances are you have heard about Massplanner. Since the shutdown, many marketers are scrambling to find an equal alternative.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll talk about Massplanner, its features, why it was popular, and then move on to some of our recommended alternatives.</p>
<p>Before we get into that, let&#8217;s talk about why Massplanner was shut down.</p>
<h2>Why Was Massplanner Shut Down?</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1978 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="196" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown.jpg 806w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown-300x98.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown-768x251.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>At some point in 2017 when marketers tried to visit the Massplanner website they were met with the notice that says &#8220;Sorry, our service is discontinued&#8221;. It still remains today.</p>
<p>As you probably know, Instagram doesn&#8217;t want third-party tools using the words &#8220;Insta&#8221; or &#8220;Gram&#8221; in their names. This is one of the most common reasons for Instagram to file a lawsuit against Instagram bots.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Massplanner didn&#8217;t seem to violate that rule. However, after a closer look, it becomes quite clear why Instagram filed a lawsuit against Massplanner.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Massplanner not only has services to automate a wide range of Instagram activity but also create fake accounts using proxies. These fake accounts were basically sold and used as like-farms and whatnot, something that Instagram clearly doesn&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>In short, it broke too many of Instagram&#8217;s rules. Most bots can get away with breaking a couple, or at least working within a grey-area, but Massplanner went all out.</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact Massplanner was one of the most popular tools for black-hat marketers, it&#8217;s not surprising Instagram took action. Discussions about the tool are still quite popular on internet marketing forums, such as Warrior Forum and Black Hat World.</p>
<h2>What Made Massplanner Special?</h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-1977 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplanneradvertisement.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="478" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplanneradvertisement.jpg 562w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplanneradvertisement-300x286.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering why this tool was so popular when there are so many other similar tools out there. From what I can tell, there are several reasons for that. For starters, Massplanner had so many features.</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automate activity on every social media platform (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, etc)</li>
<li>Auto-follow &amp; Unfollow Users</li>
<li>Schedule and Upload Content</li>
<li>Mass-Account Creator</li>
<li>Auto Comment</li>
<li>Direct Message</li>
<li>Auto Like</li>
<li>And many others.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, it was a full-scale Instagram bot, with almost every possible feature.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, not all the features were included in the core price.</p>
<h2>How Did It Work?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1979" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures.jpg" alt="" width="1332" height="600" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures.jpg 1332w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures-300x135.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures-768x346.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures-1024x461.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1332px) 100vw, 1332px" /></p>
<p>Look, Massplanner was a software, a Windows application to be specific. You had to download and install it on your computer or a virtual private server.</p>
<p>You weren&#8217;t allowed to use the program on more than one computer and you were supposed to use a proxy to avoid detection. In other words, your computer needed to be on for the tool to work.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of tools out there that use a similar system, one that comes to mind is Jarvee. <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/jarvee/" data-wpel-link="internal">Read our detailed Jarvee review here.</a></p>
<p>Getting started with Massplaner was much the same as tools you might be familiar with now. Users would have to enter their Follow Sources, which are keywords, hashtags, or other users. These settings create a starting point for the bot.</p>
<p>Once you did that, all that&#8217;s left to do is hit the Start Auto Follow button and watch the live activity.</p>
<p>Massplanner catered more towards advanced marketers. It had a wide range of services that were not found in other Instagram bots, at least not at that time.</p>
<p>It also had plenty of filters. You could customize the settings of almost every action, including wait periods. When used correctly, Instagram would have a hard time figuring out if you&#8217;re using a bot or not.</p>
<p>Here are some of the filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait between actions (set a custom time)</li>
<li>Follow during certain hours of the day</li>
<li>Follow a range of people</li>
<li>Add random intervals to pause the bot</li>
<li>Wait a certain amount of seconds between each follow</li>
<li>A random sleep timer</li>
<li>Add follow limits</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Much Did Massplanner Cost?</h2>
<p>To start with, they offered a 5-day free trial.</p>
<p>After that, there were a handful of paid memberships to choose from, starting from $9.95 a month for the basic version. A six-month license costs $44.95.</p>
<p>There were also some add-on modules, such as Instagram Poster, InstaChat, Multi-Account Module, Bump, and many others. These were add-ons for specific social media platforms.</p>
<p>Overall, it wasn&#8217;t pricey. In fact, it was quite affordable, which may be why so many people were drawn to it.</p>
<h2>What Happened When Massplanner Shutdown?</h2>
<p>The news that Massplanner closed their doors came as a shock. Nobody was really expecting it, and many marketers were using the tool for their business.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at that time, Instagram was cracking down on these kinds of tools, and many other tools had to close down as well. The people who were using Massplanner rushed to other tools, only to have those shut down as well.</p>
<p>You can tell how upset some people were by the number of discussions about this issue on internet marketing forums. Well, there some things we can learn from this situation.</p>
<h3>What We Can Learn From This:</h3>
<p>Truth be told, using any type of social media automation comes with risks. Granted, they can save you a lot of time as well, but nothing lasts forever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always best not to rely too heavily on social media automation tools. Instagram bots have their uses, but you shouldn&#8217;t depend on them entirely. At least have backup tools to fall on when one shuts down.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the reasons Massplanner shut down was because marketers were getting a bit too greedy and pushing the limits. They created and managed thousands of accounts with the tool, selling Instagram likes and other interactions to people online.</p>
<h3>Too Many Spammers:</h3>
<p>Essentially, Massplanner was the source of a lot of spam. Instagram doesn&#8217;t like spam. Not many people do. Massplanner was used to not only create thousands of fake accounts but manage those accounts too.</p>
<p>What ended up happening is various marketers had armies of accounts creating spam. It&#8217;s no wonder Instagram caught on quick.</p>
<p>Look, if you&#8217;re going to use an Instagram automation tool, take it really slow at first. New accounts need to keep the activity looking as human as possible. Don&#8217;t start spamming all the services at once.</p>
<h3>There Are Always Risks:</h3>
<p>And you also need to remember, even if you follow all the recommendations, and continue to use bots, there&#8217;s still the off chance that you&#8217;ll be blocked. Instagram doesn&#8217;t usually ban users for weird activity, not immediately at least, but repeat offenders will eventually be banned.</p>
<p>I think if Massplanner only offered a few services and places strict limits on its users, the company would probably still be up and running today. Then again, it probably wouldn&#8217;t have been as popular.</p>
<p>Overall, though, if you pay close attention to the tool&#8217;s tutorials and advice, then the chances of you running into trouble are minimal.</p>
<h2>Looking for a Massplanner Alternative?</h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear picture, here are alternatives to Massplanner.</p>
<p>The tool that is most similar to Massplanner is Jarvee, but it&#8217;s not something we recommend for complete beginners. Like Massplanner, it has a ton of features and settings which can be overwhelming for new marketers.</p>
<p>So what do we recommend?</p>
<p>Out of all the<a href="//socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> Instagram tools we love</a>, here are two of our favorites:</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Kenji</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2147 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-1024x540.jpg" alt="Kenji.ai is an alternative to massplanner" width="1024" height="540" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-300x158.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>What we like most about Kenji is that it keeps things simple. The platform can be accessed online, so there&#8217;s no need to download any apps, and it is very easy to setup.</p>
<p>Basically, all you have to do is type in your targets and toggle the services you want, that&#8217;s it. Setup can be completed in minutes. It&#8217;s also budget-friendly!</p>
<p><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Click here to try a three-day trial. </a></p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Upleap</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2146 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-1024x510.png" alt="alternative for massplanner" width="1024" height="510" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-1024x510.png 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-300x149.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-768x383.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram.png 1698w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Upleap is a unique platform. What it does is pair you with an account manager who generates Instagram activity on your behalf. It&#8217;s the closest thing to hiring a full-time social media marketer for your account.</p>
<p>The difference is Upleap is much cheaper, and you can easily track the performance inside your dashboard. Upleap is our favorite Instagram automation tool. Granted, it&#8217;s not the cheapest, but it&#8217;s well worth it.</p>
<p><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Start the three-day trial. </a></p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Later</h3>
<p>Later is more of an Instagram manager than a bot. It doesn&#8217;t automate activity for you but it does allow you to schedule content. The platform has a really cool grid-style calendar that lets you schedule and publishes content for the entire year.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not the best Massplanner alternative, it&#8217;s worth mentioning because it can really benefit your social media activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://later.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Take a look. </a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal:</p>
<p>The above Instagram automation tools aren&#8217;t as aggressive as Massplanner. Unlike Massplanner, these tools only work with Instagram, no other social media platforms. They also don&#8217;t have the account-creator that Massplanner was known for.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you&#8217;re looking to organically grow your Instagram account, with the help of some automation tools, then these two of your best choices.</p>
<h2>Massplanner In Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize, Massplanner was a decent bot. It provides a high level of customization and features that most bots today don&#8217;t have. However, marketers flooded to the tool and used it a bit too aggressively. It wasn&#8217;t long before it appeared on Instagram&#8217;s radar and they took action against it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking if this happened to Massplanner, then chances are it can happen again to any automation tool. That it may be true. There are always risks. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend relying too heavily on any single tool.</p>
<p>A couple of pointers to keep in mind:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to avoid tools with the words &#8220;Gram&#8221; or &#8220;Insta&#8221; in their names. These will likely be the first to go when Instagram starts the ban-waves. Secondly, keep away from ones that mass-create accounts or sell followers. You can&#8217;t go wrong with one of our recommendations.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only so much a bot can do. You still need to be making quality content. Automation tools can help make the process easier, and save you time, but you&#8217;ll still need to do some work.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Massplanner review. I hope you learned something new and you choose one of our recommended Instagram automation tools. They&#8217;ll save you a lot of hassle!</p>
<p>Remember, when you use a tool that requires a lot of customization, it&#8217;s best to keep all the settings to the lowest possible, at least at first.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been searching for the ultimate Instagram marketing tool, chances are you have heard about Combin. You&#8217;re probably wondering if this tool is worth your time. After playing around with the tool for a few days, I decided to write this Combin review to share my experience with you.</p>
<h2>Is Combin a Bot?</h2>
<p>Look, if you&#8217;re planning to use this tool to automatically grow your Instagram account, there&#8217;s something that you need to know. Combin is not an Instagram bot.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t automate activity on your profile. It won&#8217;t auto follow users, like content, or leave comments. The tool is more for audience management.</p>
<p>In other words, a dashboard with reports, charts, and other analytical marketing tools to build an extremely targeted following.</p>
<p>In other words, it doesn&#8217;t perform any actions for you. But it does give you the option to manually interact with accounts.</p>
<p>However, I noticed Combin is planning to launch auto-tasks soon. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s unclear when the changes will be added. We will keep a close eye on Combin and update this review whenever they add new features.</p>
<h3>Combin Products</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1471 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-1024x295.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="295" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-1024x295.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-300x86.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-768x221.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts.jpg 1787w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>First things first, Combin has two products: Growth and Scheduler. The Growth is focused on audience management while Scheduler is simply a tool for uploading and schedule posts and Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>Before you get too excited, unfortunately Scheduler hasn&#8217;t been released yet. It&#8217;s marked as &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; which is a shame because it seems like quite a useful product.</p>
<h3>Installation Required</h3>
<p>Another important thing you need to know about this tool is you have to download it and run it on your computer. Luckily, there are versions for all major operating systems, such as Windows, IOS, and even Ubuntu. At the moment, there is no browser based version.</p>
<p>To access the program, you have to download and install it. Thankfully, the system requirements are very low, the only requirement is 4GB of RAM and 2 GB of disk space. It doesn&#8217;t consume a lot of resources, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re probably wondering if you need to use a VPS to run this program 24/7. Since the tool doesn&#8217;t automate activity (it&#8217;s not a bot) you don&#8217;t need to have it open and running all the time. In other words, there&#8217;s no reason to buy a VPS for this tool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have more than one Instagram account, Combin does recommend use proxies from their recommended list. The point is to get a dedicated proxy so your login location doesn&#8217;t keep switching every time, a clear sign you&#8217;re using a bot.</p>
<h3>Prices &amp; Fees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starter &#8211; Free</li>
<li>Personal &#8211; $10/month</li>
<li>Business &#8211;  $30/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: These prices are for Combin Growth because Combin Scheduler hasn&#8217;t been released yet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1472 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-1024x192.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="192" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-1024x192.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-300x56.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-768x144.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices.jpg 1705w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the prices are reasonable. I like how they include a free account for you to play around with.</p>
<p>The Starter account does have some limits, but it should give you an idea of how the tool works. It&#8217;s also nice to know there are no time limits or hidden fees &#8211; it&#8217;s free &#8211; forever.</p>
<p>Eventually, Personal and Business will include auto-tasks, although we&#8217;re not sure when those features will arrive. Until then, the main difference between the subscription plans are the numbers of accounts you can connect.</p>
<p>With Starter and Personal, you can only connect<strong> one Instagram account</strong>. With Business, you can connect up to 5 for free, with the option to buy slots for 10 more.</p>
<p>Now that we got the basics out of the way, I&#8217;ll show you what this tool can do for you.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Combin</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1473 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinlogin.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="557" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinlogin.jpg 511w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinlogin-275x300.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" /></p>
<p>Think of Combin more like an Instagram user search tool. It has a lot of filters you can use to find very specific users on Instagram.</p>
<p>After connecting Combin to your Instagram account, the next step is to create a New Search. You can either search for posts or users.</p>
<h3>Searching for Posts</h3>
<p>Searching for posts is useful because you can not only like those posts but also interact with the owners of the pictures.</p>
<p>With Combin, you can search for posts by location or hashtag or both together. This makes it easy for you to send out &#8220;Pings&#8221; to other people in your industry.</p>
<h3>Searching for Users</h3>
<p>Now this feature is probably the most useful. It&#8217;s the main feature you&#8217;ll be using to build your audience. What this is mainly designed for is to build a similar audience as your competition.</p>
<p>To start you&#8217;ll need the username of a profile you want to compete with.</p>
<p>Select the &#8220;Search By&#8221; option from the drop down menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>Followings</li>
<li>Commenters</li>
<li>Likers</li>
<li>Bio</li>
<li>Users List</li>
</ol>
<p>And now you fill in the relevant results. For example, if you select the &#8220;Followers&#8221; option, the tool will find all the followers of the specific user you added earlier. Likewise, the &#8220;Commenters&#8221; option will show all the people who left comments, and so on.</p>
<p>You can also use the Advanced Filter and Analysis to narrow down the users even further. For instance, hide inefficient accounts, filter by gender, filter by language, filter by last activity, and what not.</p>
<p>If you use these filters correctly, it should be easy to build a following of active users.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Bio filter allows you to search for users that contain a specific keyword in their bio description.</p>
<h3>Sliders</h3>
<p>With every search, there&#8217;s a likes and comment slider, even for hashtag searches. The purpose of these sliders is to set a range of activity. It&#8217;s useful for finding active users that are using the same hashtag you&#8217;re searching for. In other words, a great way to guarantee you only find active users.</p>
<h3>Manage Your Followers</h3>
<p>Once cool feature of this app is you can easily manage your own followers. You can see who is not following you back and mass follow and un-follow users with a few clicks.</p>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s best not to un-follow too many users at one time. Limit the amount of follows and un-follows to a handful, at least at first.</p>
<h3>Export a List</h3>
<p>Another great feature is the ability to export a list of Instagram users. You can make a list for almost every type of user.</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users Following</li>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>Unfollowed</li>
<li>Safe List</li>
<li>Black List</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it very easy to organize users or import lists into other projects. Great for data geeks!</p>
<h2>Combin Pros</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the pros.</p>
<h3>Safe 👍</h3>
<p>When it comes to Instagram tools, the first question people ask is, &#8220;Is It a Safe?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since Combin does not automate any activity on your profile, it&#8217;s very safe. Think of it more like a Instagram browser and management tool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the option to interact with users manually. And if you interact with too many users at a time, then Instagram might temporarily lock your account.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can add proxies for an extra layer of security. Overall, I feel like Combin is perfectly safe, and there&#8217;s no need to worry about being banned.</p>
<h3>Budget-Friendly 👍</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, Combin is a very cheap Instagram management tool. The fact that they have a free-forever starter account is great too. The paid version only costs $10 a month. Granted, it won&#8217;t automatically build your audience for you, but it&#8217;s a decent tool for searching and managing users.</p>
<h3>Schedule Posts with Growth 👍</h3>
<p>Growth is a separate product from Combin that can be used to upload and schedule posts. Personally, I really like this tool. Not only can you schedule posts, but also add all the relevant details, such as descriptions, hashtags, and location.</p>
<p>You can also schedule posts down to the minute and view all your scheduled posts in a nice grid calendar layout. Definitely worth looking into.</p>
<p>P.S. Take a look at <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/the-top-5-instagram-schedulers/" data-wpel-link="internal">our recommended Instagram schedulers! </a></p>
<h3>Easily Interact with Users and Posts 👍</h3>
<p>One thing I really liked about this tool is you can easily interact with users and posts you find. In the search results you&#8217;ll see quick-action buttons for the actions. You can leave comments, like the post, and even direct message users.</p>
<p>The good news is you can also easily manage your own content, for instance, reply to comments on your posts. I thought this was really cool because you can search for hashtags using the activity sliders and then just like all the posts on there, sending out pings to lots of users.</p>
<h2>Combin Cons</h2>
<p>And now for the downsides.</p>
<h3>No Auto Tasks (Coming Soon!) 👎</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, currently Combin does not include auto tasks. I see how this might be a deal breaker for people looking to quickly grow their accounts. It seems like this service has been in the planning stages for quite some time now.</p>
<h3>Has to Run on Your Computer 👎</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Combin is not browser based. You have to download and install it. It can be a little bothersome to open the program and login every time you want to use it.</p>
<h3>Case by Case Refund Policy 👎</h3>
<p>Most software companies will grant you a full refund with no questions asked. With Combin, they&#8217;ll only refund your order if your situation meets their requirements for a refund.</p>
<p>They only grant refunds for specific cases. For more details on that, read <a href="https://www.combin.com/refund-policy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">their official refund policy</a>. The good news is you cancel at any time, and it&#8217;s very cheap, so the risks are low.</p>
<h3>Prone to Errors 👎</h3>
<p>While researching Combin, I kept coming across posts from users struggling with various errors. It seems like Combin is prone to some unexplained errors. One of these is &#8220;Waiting for Instagram Callback&#8221; while the app straight up crashes for some users. It also seems a bit unstable, some days it works, other days not at all.</p>
<h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>Our overall combin review: 👎</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering if Combin is a tool we recommend. Although we don&#8217;t have any hard feelings towards this tool, it&#8217;s not something we wholeheartedly recommend. Nevertheless, I feel like it&#8217;s a decent tool and definitely can be used to grow a highly targeted audience.</p>
<p>Based on the cons mentioned earlier, I don&#8217;t think Combin is worth it for long term use. The main issue for me is the unreliable performance. I don&#8217;t want to have to sit around all day waiting for the callback error to disappear.</p>
<p>In addition to the errors, some times the features won&#8217;t work at all. For example, when you create a new search, no results show. It seems like recently the tool hasn&#8217;t been working well at all.</p>
<h2>Combin Alternatives</h2>
<p>Looking for a Combin alternative? I&#8217;v got you covered.</p>
<p>Below I&#8217;ll briefly introduce two Instagram automation tools from our list of <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">recommended Instagram managers.</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a> &#8211; Free Trial 🌟 (No CC Required)</h3>
<p>The way Upleap works is pretty cool. They assign a real person to your Instagram account to create activity on your behalf. It&#8217;s like hiring your own personal social media marketer but at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Your manager will leave comments, like posts, and anything else you request of them. The best part is you can sign up for the free trial without entering any credit card information.</p>
<p>Upleap isn&#8217;t really a bot, so it&#8217;s much safer than most automation tools.</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji</a> &#8211; Free Trial 🌟 (No CC Required)</h3>
<p>For those of you on a budget, Kenji is worth a look. Kenji uses machine learning AI technology to mimic human behavior on your account.</p>
<p>What it does is basically copy the way that you use your Instagram account and then automate that activity over and over. It&#8217;s very budget-friendly. And you can also sign-up without a credit card.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind Kenji is an automation Instagram bot.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s important to remember Instagram is always on the lookout for people using bots.</p>
<p>Although they probably won&#8217;t straight-up ban you, they will lock you out of your account, and require other confirmation, which can be incredibly bothersome. So, when it comes to using any Instagram tool, make sure to take necessary precautions!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Combin review. Hopefully now you know if the tool is worth your time or not. If you liked the post, don&#8217;t forget to share it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Gramista worth it? Read this Gramista review to learn if this tool is worth your time and money.Gramista claims to take your Instagram to the next level by automating activity on your account. It claims to be the absolute best Instagram bot out there.</p>
<p>In this review we&#8217;ll be covering a number of topics, such as: it&#8217;s price, safety, effectiveness, if it&#8217;s user friendly, and if there are any better alternatives out there.</p>
<p>Ready to know how this tool works?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>What is Gramista?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1577 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="257" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout.jpg 854w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout-300x128.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout-768x328.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Gramista is an Instagram tool designed to automate activity on your account. It automates a number of actions, saving you a lot of time in the long run.</p>
<p>What this tool does is automate the tedious tasks such as Liking content and following profiles, allowing you to focus on other areas of your social media business.</p>
<h2>How Gramista Works</h2>
<p>Gramista is a little different than most Instagram bots. The system is based on the human curiosity and reciprocity. In simple terms, the tool is built on people&#8217;s need to return the favor.</p>
<p>For example, when you like someone&#8217;s post on Instagram, they&#8217;ll probably return the favor by liking one of your posts. Gramista aims to send out a lot of these little pings, in the form of likes and follows, in hopes that the target profiles will do the same. As it turns out, most people will return the favor.</p>
<p>Their core service is called &#8220;Liker&#8221; which is based on this principle.</p>
<p>(Kicksta uses a similar service, <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/kickstagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">read our Kicksta review here</a>)</p>
<p>On that note, Gramista doesn&#8217;t straight-up spam profiles will comments, likes, messages, and all sorts of actions. It uses calculated algorithms to simulate human behavior, not spam. It&#8217;s important to understand the difference. There&#8217;s a mode called Smart Mode that uses AI to simulate human actions.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of Instagram bots make the same promises.</p>
<p>Does this one <em>really</em> work?</p>
<h2>Do You Have to Download Gramista?</h2>
<p>I understand downloading Instagram tools can be bothersome. The good news is Gramista works completely in your web-browser, and you don&#8217;t have to have the window open for it to work.</p>
<p>No need to download and install any programs. It makes things a lot easier because you don&#8217;t have to worry about virtual private servers and what not.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering:</p>
<h2>What are Gramista&#8217;s Prices?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1582 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="271" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages.jpg 1112w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages-300x135.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages-768x347.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages-1024x462.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Gramista uses an interesting pricing structure. Instead of the usual monthly subscriptions, Gramista has a wide range of time-based single packages.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the list of packages:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 Day &#8211; $1.79</li>
<li>3 Days &#8211; $4.99</li>
<li>7 Days &#8211; $10.99</li>
<li>30 Days &#8211; $39.99</li>
<li>60 Days &#8211; $64.99</li>
<li>90 Days &#8211; $89.99</li>
</ol>
<h2>Does Gramista Have a Free Trial?</h2>
<p>The good news is Gramista does offer a free trial, although it&#8217;s not as long as other Instagram tools. With Gramista, the free trial lasts for 12 hours, and the countdown starts as soon as you link your Instagram account.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the option to buy a one or three day package, which is usually enough to test out the tool and see if it works. The one day package is essentially a free trial because it only costs $1.79.</p>
<h3>The Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Before I get into the tool&#8217;s features, I wanted to take a moment to share the internet&#8217;s opinion of Gramista.</p>
<p>Taking a look at their Trust Pilot page, the reviews don&#8217;t look good. It has a two out of five star rating with 90% of users rating it Bad or one star.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1477 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="508" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot.jpg 909w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot-300x254.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot-768x650.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Granted, at the moment, there are only 10 reviews on that page. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s clear the tool doesn&#8217;t have the best reputation online.</p>
<p>On that note, the Trust Pilot page hasn&#8217;t been claimed by the company either, so it&#8217;s unclear if they even care about their online reputation.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll discuss the possible reasons for the negativity later on in the cons section of this Gramista review.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s move on to Gramista&#8217;s features:</p>
<h2>Gramista&#8217;s Features</h2>
<p>Gramista automates three actions: Likes, Follows, and Unfollow (the last two are bundled together).</p>
<p>Note: <em>The Liking service is called &#8220;Liker&#8221;. </em></p>
<p>These two services can be toggled on and off in the main dashboard, and you can also set the desired speed (Slow, Normal, and Fast).</p>
<p>What Liker does is what you imagine, it likes a wide range of content that falls within the parameters you specify with the target filters.</p>
<p>When used with appropriate targets, this service is supposed to be enough to quickly boost your Instagram audience. There are also a couple other features, such as Boost and Smart Mode.</p>
<p>Note: Speaking of likes, wondering <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-instagram-likes/" data-wpel-link="internal">how to get more likes on Instagram? </a></p>
<p>Before you start using these services, you&#8217;ll want to set up a target audience.</p>
<h3>Targeting Options</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1580 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="356" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags.jpg 892w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags-300x178.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>With Gramista, there are three ways to target profiles: Hashtags, Usernames, and Locations.</p>
<p>Almost everyone adds hashtags to their new posts, so that&#8217;s one way to find plenty of content. The Username filter will interact with the followers of a target username, instead of that specific username. It&#8217;s a good way to keep up with your competition.</p>
<p>And Location works as you would imagine, a decent filter for building local brands and what not. There&#8217;s also filter for Gender, as well as blacklists.</p>
<p>Once you setup accurate and specific targets, the only thing left to do is enable the services. Gramista will take it from there, and the Liker tool will start liking all the content related to your targets.</p>
<p>And the follow and unfollow tool will quietly work in the background.</p>
<h3>Follow &amp; Unfollow</h3>
<p>At Gramista, these two are bundled together,and run automatically in user-specified cycles. You can choose to run this service in Smart Mode, which is a recommended option, enabled by default.</p>
<p>The Smart Mode is an anti-spam filter mode. It basically creates random patterns for the scripts, instead of running them all in a row, which is easy for Instagram to detect. It also remembers which accounts you followed with the tool so you don&#8217;t keep interacting with the same accounts, not to mention a few other behind-the-scenes tasks.</p>
<p>The Smart Mode service works in cycles, following a batch, and then unfollowing the people who don&#8217;t follow back. An interesting feature is you can manually change the cycle periods in the settings menu, although the default settings are usually enough.</p>
<p>Cycles are basically limits. I always recommend keeping the bot limits as low as possible, at least as first. It&#8217;s better to be on the safe side. The default value for the cycles is 1,000 users but I recommend lowering it 100 or even lower.</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry!</p>
<h3>What About Boost?</h3>
<p>Boost is a service that does exactly what you would expect. It basically adds a quick injection of likes and activity to improve exposure on your posts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an optional service. And only recommended for older accounts. The good news is it can&#8217;t be enabled all the time, it only runs for 1 &#8211; 2 hours, and then has a 24 hour cool-down period before you can use it again.</p>
<p>Now that you have a basic idea what this tool can do, let&#8217;s run through the pros and cons.</p>
<h2>Gramista Review: Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the pros.</p>
<h3>Simple &amp; User-Friendly 👍</h3>
<p>One thing I really liked about this tool is the simplicity. There are really only two main services you need to know about, and you don&#8217;t need to manually input any limits or settings.</p>
<p>The default settings are usually good enough to start with. Basically, the only thing you need to do is sign-in with your Instagram account and toggle the two services. That&#8217;s it. Very easy to use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also web-based.</p>
<h3>Budget-Friendly &amp; Flexible Packages 👍</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, the team at Gramista made their packages extremely accessible. There packages for people on a tight budget as well as for people working with more substantial funds.</p>
<p>What I really liked is not only can you sign-up for a 12-hour free trial, but you also buy  short periods of time, such as one day, or three days, for only a  few dollars. Very nice.</p>
<p>On the subject of prices, their refund policy is they do not entertain refund requests unless there is clear evidence that the tool is not working as promised. In other words, if you have an account and everything is working fine, they won&#8217;t give you a refund.</p>
<h3>Not Too Aggressive 👍</h3>
<p>Although the tool does have the Boost mode, it has a cool-down timer, so it can&#8217;t be overused. I liked how Gramista has a lot of anti-spam filters in place, which may be why they&#8217;re service is still operational when many similar companies are going down.</p>
<p>Their core service is based on liking content, that&#8217;s it. Actually, the following service is completely optional. As we know, Instagram won&#8217;t ban you for liking too much content.</p>
<p>So for those of you who are wondering if Gramista is safe, I have to say it looks quite safe to me. They also have a sleep mode which shuts the scripts off during the night-time in whichever timezone you select.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably one of the safer Instagram manager tools out there.</p>
<h3>Recent Activity Feed 👍</h3>
<p>Wondering what the tool is doing behind the scenes? In the dashboard you can find a Recent Activity feed that will show a real-time action-feed of your account.</p>
<p>For example, it shows who the bot followed, what content it liked, if it&#8217;s taking a break, and what not. A great way to keep an eye on your activity!</p>
<h3>Not a Great Reputation Online 👎</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s clear the company doesn&#8217;t have a great reputation online.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to find their official Instagram account, and their Twitter page hasn&#8217;t been updated in over two years. Speaking of their Twitter, there are a lot of people complaining on Twitter, but Gramista hasn&#8217;t even replied to any of them.</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that they aren&#8217;t trying to claim the Trust Pilot page and resolve the complaints is a little suspicious to me. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. But it looks like they&#8217;re not too concerned with their reputation.</p>
<p>Also their blog is updated once every few months:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1578 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistablog.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="537" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistablog.jpg 704w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistablog-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>It looks like their customer service in general is rather slow. Most of the people who complain about their customer service said they emailed the team multiple times and never got a response.</p>
<h3>Uses &#8220;Gram&#8221; in Their Name 👎</h3>
<p>Although not a major deal breaker, many similar tools have been shutdown for using words that Instagram has trademarked.</p>
<p>Take a look at this screenshot taken from <a href="https://en.instagram-brand.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram&#8217;s brand policies</a>:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1572 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagrambrandguidelines.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagrambrandguidelines.jpg 634w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagrambrandguidelines-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter of time before Instagram get on their case about it. If that happens, you can be sure they&#8217;ll shutdown instantly, taking your campaigns with them.</p>
<h3>Unreliable 👎</h3>
<p>It looks like a lot of people have encountered this issue. From what I can tell, the tool works great for the first few days, and then the performance starts going downhill, sometimes stopping completely. It&#8217;s frustrating to pay for a tool the stops working after a few days.</p>
<p>It looks like the activity can stop randomly and there&#8217;s no way to get it started again, even after contacting their support team. In short, when it works, it works good. But it doesn&#8217;t always work.</p>
<h2>Gramista Review Conclusion: Any Alternatives?</h2>
<p>Overall, I think Gramista is an okay tool. The Liker service is interesting enough and has potential. But I don&#8217;t get a good feeling from their customer support and it looks like a lot of people are running into issues with the tool. At the moment, I feel like Gramista is not good enough to recommend. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t recommend it.</p>
<h3><strong>Alternatives</strong></h3>
<p>We won&#8217;t leave you hanging here. There are plenty of <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">other Instagram managers</a> that we do recommend, two of which are listed below:</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji</a></h3>
<p>Kenji is a great little Instagram bot. It&#8217;s budget-friendly, fast, and safe. What more could you want? They also have a three day trial you can take advantage of without entering your credit card information.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Now Upleap is a little pricier because it&#8217;s not &#8211; technically &#8211; a bot. Upleap hires actual social media managers to take over your accounts and automate activity. It&#8217;s a really cool platform, that&#8217;s for sure. And you can also try it out for three days, for free, without any credit card details.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Gramista review! Hopefully now you have enough information to make the best decision for your business.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know if Hublaagram is worth it? Are there better alternatives? Hublaagram is an Instagram bot designed to get you more likes, followers, and comments.</p>
<p>You can choose to download the APK file for Android or install the web browser extension for Google or Firefox. It also looks like the company has plans to launch on the Apple store too.</p>
<p>Look:</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll cut the chase. I didn&#8217;t have a good experience with Hublaagram. Not only was their service sub-par, but I encountered some strange pop-ups on their website. Not to mention a bunch of broken links. Suffice to say, I was not impressed.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re convinced Hublaagram is not worth it, I&#8217;ll share some of my favorite alternatives below.</p>
<h2>Our Favorite Hublaagram Alternatives</h2>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1 &#8211; Kenji </a></h3>
<p>Kenji can be used to quickly build an audience on Instagram. The tool uses artificial intelligence to generate activity on your Instagram account.</p>
<p>It also has tons of anti-spam filters, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about Instagram blocking your account. Kenji is also a great choice for budget marketers.</p>
<p>You can sign-up to their free 3-day trial to take it for a test run.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">2 &#8211; Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Upleap&#8217;s slogan is, &#8220;Get More Instagram Followers with a Dedicated Account Manager&#8221;.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what the tool does. Instead of running scripts on your account, as most bots do, Upleap assigns a professional account manager to you. With this system, you can expect steady organic growth.</p>
<p>Upleap is a little more expensive, but if you&#8217;re serious about growing your social media accounts, it&#8217;s worth looking into.</p>
<p>The best part is they also offer a 3-day trial with no credit card required.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<h2>How Does Hublaagram Work?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription.jpg" alt="" width="1546" height="358" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription.jpg 1546w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription-300x69.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription-768x178.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription-1024x237.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1546px) 100vw, 1546px" /></p>
<p>Curious to know how Hublaagram works and why we don&#8217;t recommend them?</p>
<p>To start with, finding accurate information about this app is rather difficult because they have many different websites that advertise a variety of features. It&#8217;s not clear which website is real. It also seems to go by the name Hublaa Helper.</p>
<p>From what I could gather, Hublaagram&#8217;s system is a little different. What the system does is exchange activity with other accounts every 10 minutes, such as followers, likes, and comments.</p>
<p>For example, you can choose to submit your followers to the platform, and then receive followers from other people submitting their followers. In other words, it&#8217;s like a crowd-sourced pool of Instagram activity. You put something in and get something back.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, that&#8217;s the main concept.</p>
<h2>Hublaagram&#8217;s Core Features</h2>
<p>If you manage to get through the spam, Hublaagram has a few core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instaliker</li>
<li>Instacomment</li>
<li>Instafollow</li>
</ul>
<p>They all work basically the same, exchanging activity with other members.</p>
<p>Instaliker is another way of saying buying Instagram likes.</p>
<p>What you do is choose the number of likes you want, and the post you want them on and hit purchase. It doesn&#8217;t interact with accounts like other apps, it straight up sends likes your post.</p>
<p>Speaking of Instagram likes, want to learn <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-instagram-likes/" data-wpel-link="internal">the best way to get Instagram likes? </a></p>
<p>And as you can imagine, the likes come from fake profiles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing:</p>
<p>Most of the links on the website don&#8217;t work, so there&#8217;s no real way to test the app.</p>
<h3>Red Flags</h3>
<p>While testing out this app, I kept running into red-flags after red-flags.</p>
<h4>1 &#8211; Strange Pop-ups <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Now this one bothered me the most. I simply clicked on the link to watch a tutorial on how the tool works and my browser was redirected to an adult webcam website. Very unprofessional.</p>
<p>It happened every time I clicked on a link too. I&#8217;m not sure if that was intentional, or the website was hacked, either way, it&#8217;s inappropriate.</p>
<p>The other Hublaagram websites were riddled with spam too, either gambling sites or random squeeze pages for making money online.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I had ad-block enabled too.</p>
<h4>2 &#8211; Multiple Poorly Made Company Websites <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Another major red flag is the fact that the app has multiple websites with its name on it. And the funny part is they&#8217;re all equally as bad.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list I managed to find, there may be more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hublaagram.to</li>
<li>Hublaagram.me</li>
<li>Instagramrealfollowers.com</li>
<li>Hublaagram.co.id</li>
</ul>
<p>The other websites also have lots of pop-ups and broken links. It&#8217;s clear the team behind Hublaagram isn&#8217;t very professional.</p>
<p>The Instagram Real Followers website has more information than the rest, but it&#8217;s insecure. And when you click on &#8220;Packages&#8221; you&#8217;re redirected to another website about buying Instagram likes.</p>
<p>Very strange.</p>
<h4>3 &#8211; Absolutely No Filters <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>To make matters worse, the tool provides absolutely no filters. It allows anyone to submit and receive followers for anyone. No way to vent followers.</p>
<p>What this means is you &#8211; more often than not &#8211; end up with tons of fake profiles, with no profile pictures, no bios, and a bunch of numbers in their user handle. Terrible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll take a long time to purge these accounts from your profile.</p>
<p>Getting more followers on Instagram is always nice, but if they do nothing for your business, it&#8217;s worthless.</p>
<h4>4 &#8211; Might Steal Your Password <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Based on what I have seen on the website, I&#8217;m sure Hublaagram is not a safe tool.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t give them the password to my main Instagram account, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>If their websites are riddled with spam, there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll steal your password and data.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<h4>5 &#8211; APK Download Only <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s only the option to down their APK file which is unverified and a little risky.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not on Google Play or Apple, and their Chrome extension doesn&#8217;t work either.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1771" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror.jpg" alt="" width="854" height="314" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror.jpg 854w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror-300x110.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror-768x282.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>In fact, it redirects to a broken link. The only way to access the app is via their APK download from a third-party website.</p>
<p>To do that, you&#8217;ll need to have an Android phone and enable unverified app installations on it.</p>
<p>Risky. Not recommended.</p>
<h4>6 &#8211; No About Page <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Hublaagram&#8217;s websites do not reveal any information about who created the tool.</p>
<p>Actually, there&#8217;s hardly any information at all. It looks quite suspicious. Even the knowledge base is completely empty.</p>
<p>On one of their websites, they say &#8220;Hublaagram is not made by a single person but by Hublaagram Team who would like to stay anonymous&#8221;.</p>
<h4>7 &#8211; Official Hublaa Account on Twitter Has Two Tweets <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>I managed to find the company&#8217;s Twitter account, and it only has two Tweets.</p>
<p>On those Tweets, there are responses from Hublaagram users, most of which are saying the service does not work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1740" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="594" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking.jpg 808w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-150x150.jpg 150w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-300x297.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-768x759.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Their second Tweet is asking for Facebook accounts because all of their accounts got banned.</p>
<p>If all their Facebook accounts got banned, do you really think your Instagram will be safe?</p>
<p>I know I wouldn&#8217;t want to take that risk.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 1.84615; margin-top: 1.71429rem; margin-bottom: 1.71429rem; font-size: 1.14286rem;">How Much Does It Cost?</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering how much Hublaagram costs.</p>
<p>Since there are multiple websites (and they all mention different services and prices) it&#8217;s hard to get a clear answer regarding the price.</p>
<p>From what I could tell, the core exchange service is free, but the Autoliker costs $20/month. The Autoliker sends new likes to your latest posts, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Look at this screenshot:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1739" style="font-size: 1rem;" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="298" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership.jpg 1355w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership-300x149.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership-768x381.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership-1024x508.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>On another website, it claims to have three packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 one-time for Basic</li>
<li>$15 one-time.</li>
<li>$10/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is the sign-up button links don&#8217;t even work. Nothing happens when you click them.</p>
<h3>Anything Positive?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be too negative here, but I was having a hard time finding anything to like about this tool.</p>
<p>One thing I could mention is it&#8217;s actually free. It&#8217;s not on a trial either, you can use it for free as much as you want if it ever works.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care so much about building a target audience, only numbers, then you could probably increase those numbers a bit with this tool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, building a targeted audience with this tool is practically impossible.</p>
<p>To me, I feel like it&#8217;s straight-up spam. Fake followers, Likes from fake accounts, and spam-like comments &#8211; nothing that will benefit a social media business.</p>
<p>Not sure how to build an authentic audience? <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-following/" data-wpel-link="internal">Read this.</a></p>
<h2>Our Conclusion: AVOID Hublaagram!</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret we promote our own Instagram tools, but even when it comes to a tool we don&#8217;t officially recommend, I usually say it&#8217;s worth trying out, at least.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t say that about Hublaagram. I really didn&#8217;t have a good experience with this app, and it didn&#8217;t even work for me. Not to mention all the weird pop-ups and spam.</p>
<p>I got the impression it was designed by a one-man team and abandoned because it&#8217;s half-done.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to avoid Hublaagram. It&#8217;s just too suspicious.</p>
<h2>Are There Any Hublaagram Alternatives?</h2>
<p>The two tools mentioned at the beginning of this article are a couple of great alternatives, <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji</a> and <a href="https://upleap.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a>.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re not too keen on those, feel free to take a look at our <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">full list of recommended Instagram tools. </a></p>
<p>Honestly, there are lots of decent Instagram tools. My advice is to avoid the full-scale Instagram bots unless you know how to configure them with proxies and virtual private servers.</p>
<p>Stick a tool that doesn&#8217;t spam too much and keeps activity in the normal to moderate levels. It&#8217;s much safer, in the long run.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Hublaagram review.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for unbiased information about Instazood? Wondering if it&#8217;s worth using for your Instagram account? When you&#8217;re done reading this Instazood review you&#8217;ll know exactly how the platform works, how much it costs, pros &amp; cons, and if it&#8217;s worth buying today.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there are hundreds of Instagram bots out there that promise to grow your account with real followers. The problem is most of them fail to deliver, and some are downright scams. It&#8217;s important to do your research first, as you are now, so you can avoid falling for scams or losing access to your account.</p>
<h2>What is Instazood?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-979 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodlogo.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Instazood's service description. " width="600" height="392" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodlogo.jpg 663w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodlogo-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Instazood is an online-based Instagram automation bot. The tool can complete a wide range of activity on your Instagram account such as; liking posts, leaving comments, following users, viewing stories, and much more. The good news is you can configure the bot from your web-browser, no need to download any files. In other words, it&#8217;s very convenient to access. However, there is an application to download, if you need it.</p>
<h2>Do We Recommend Instazood?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering if Instazood is a bot we recommend. Unfortunately, for reasons we&#8217;ll be mentioning later on in this review, Instazood isn&#8217;t a bot we recommend at this time. Maybe if the company updates and adds certain features, we&#8217;ll change our opinion. Until then, we feel like there are better options.</p>
<h3><strong>Instazood Alternatives: </strong></h3>
<p>Looking for an Instazood alternative? Check out these highly recommended tools:</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji.ai</a></h3>
<p>Kenji is a very cool Instagram bot because it uses artificial intelligence to interact with users and complete tasks. The bot will essentially memorize how you interact with your account and then continue the same pattern, on it&#8217;s own, completing on auto-pilot.</p>
<p>But the best part about Kenji.ai is the price. Even though the service quality is identical to other bots, Kenji costs a fraction of the price. It&#8217;s a very useful tool, and definitely worth looking into.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Technically, Upleap is not a Instagram bot. The way Upleap works is quite interesting to say the least. What they do is hire real social media marketers to take control of your account and automate activity based on your instructions and settings.</p>
<p>When you first create an account you&#8217;ll be asked to write a profile description, fill in hashtags, and specify similar accounts. From there, your part is done, and you can watch as your account manager works in the background.</p>
<p>Although this tool is a little pricey compared to other bots, it&#8217;s much safer, and the followers seem to be more genuine. Upleap is one of our favorite Instagram tools.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s get back to our Instazood review.</p>
<h2>How Much Does Instazood Cost?</h2>
<p>Instazood is like a suite of Instagram tools and each requires it&#8217;s own subscription. Currently, there is no Instazood membership that includes all of the services and features. Nevertheless, the services and prices are listed below.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is each service includes a free 3-day trial.</p>
<h3>Instazood Services and Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Instagram Bot &#8211; $14.99/month</li>
<li>Post Manager- $9.99/month</li>
<li>Comments Tracker &#8211; $9.99/month</li>
<li>Direct Message &#8211; $14.99</li>
<li>Buy Likes and Views (Custom)</li>
</ul>
<p>To give you an idea:</p>
<p>If you choose to use all of the services, the total would come to $49.96 a month. On the other hand, the company uses a balance system where you can easily add money and time to each service.</p>
<p>Click the Add More Days button and a window will pop up asking which services you want to spend your balance on. Simply check or unchecked the ones you need and the desired amount of time, and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Time Periods:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 Days</li>
<li>15 Days</li>
<li>30 Days</li>
<li>3 Months</li>
<li>Six Months</li>
<li>One Year</li>
</ul>
<p>And remember: one thing to note here is all of them are selected by default, so you&#8217;ll have to manually deselect the ones you don&#8217;t want.</p>
<h3>Instagram Bot:</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-977 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodbot.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Instazood's Instagram bot. " width="601" height="264" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodbot.jpg 963w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodbot-300x132.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instazoodbot-768x337.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Now Instazood&#8217;s bot works about the same as many other Instagram automation bots. It has the whole package of auto-services, such as: Follow, Like, Comment, and Unfollow.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of activity and target filters to narrow down your audience, making sure the bot only interacts with relevant accounts. To start the bot, click Add Target under the Promotions tab.</p>
<h3>Post Manager:</h3>
<p>Rather self-explanatory, but there are some features worth talking about. For one, you can manage most of the posts already on your Instagram account and edit the details.</p>
<p>You can also schedule, draft, and delete posts. Personally, I like the schedule feature. Scheduling Instagram posts far into the future can provide you with some peace of mind so you don&#8217;t need to actively work on publishing something every day.</p>
<h3>Comments Tracker:</h3>
<p>This service makes it easy to manage comments on your posts. You can: mark comments as important, delete comments, and reply to comments. I feel like this tool isn&#8217;t as important because you can easily manage comments from the Instagram website or app. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s an option for you.</p>
<h3>Direct Message:</h3>
<p>What this service does it let you auto direct message people. You can send welcome messages, send mass messages to followers, send messages to non-followers, and even put images in your messages. It&#8217;s a pretty useful tool for marketers, but I feel like it edges into spam-territory.</p>
<h2>Instazood Pros</h2>
<p>Now that you have a good idea of what Instazood offers, let&#8217;s take a look at the pros and cons.</p>
<h3>Decent Instagram Bot Service 🔥</h3>
<p>From what I could tell, the Instagram bot seems to work well. Inside the dashboard, you can easily toggle the activity that you want. I recommend using one or two at a time. It can automate pretty much every kind of activity for you which is nice.</p>
<h3>Post Schedule Function is Always Great 🔥</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to have a Post Schedule service, it makes things a lot easier. I always appreciate it when I come across a tool that offers this service. Definitely a thumbs up for this one.</p>
<h3>Very Easy to Use 🔥</h3>
<p>The dashboard if very well organize and simple enough for anyone to learn how to use it. Creating and connecting it to your Instagram only takes a couple of minutes too. Most of the people who used Instazood love how easy it is to get everything started.</p>
<h3>Can Use Your Own Proxies 🔥</h3>
<p>On the web-version, you can&#8217;t configure your own proxies, but you can when you download the application. Some marketers will prefer to use their own proxies because they can know for sure that they&#8217;re safe.</p>
<p>Instazood promises their default IPs are safe, but some people prefer to use their own. Either way, it&#8217;s nice feature, and one way to get some peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Good Amount of Filters &amp; Targets 🔥</h3>
<p>When you click the Add New Promotion tab you&#8217;ll see four target options for you: Followers, Locations, Hash-tags, and Targets. The last one, Targets, requires you to upload a file with your target user&#8217;s ID list. Once you have a promotion running with targets, you can add filters for each of the actions.</p>
<p>Filters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check Gender</li>
<li>Media Age</li>
<li>Skip 10% of Accounts</li>
<li>Set Limits on Follows</li>
<li>Min Posts</li>
<li>Skip Accounts with a Website</li>
<li>Black List</li>
<li>Max Followers</li>
<li>And more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, a good amount of targets and filters. I like how you can set limits on interactions, it&#8217;s a great way to reduce the risk of being banned from Instagram.</p>
<h3>Can Connect Multiple Accounts 🔥</h3>
<p>If you manage multiple Instagram accounts, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear Instazood allows you to connect unlimited accounts. The only downside here is you need to pay for each one. For example, if you want to use the Instagram Bot on three accounts, then you have to buy it for each account.</p>
<h2>Instazood Cons</h2>
<p>But even though the tool has some upsides, there are some downsides you need to know about.</p>
<h3>Low Trust Pilot Rating 👎</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-980 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/isntazoodtrustpilot.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Instazood's Trust Pilot page. " width="600" height="525" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/isntazoodtrustpilot.jpg 876w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/isntazoodtrustpilot-300x262.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/isntazoodtrustpilot-768x672.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>I noticed the Trust Pilot rating for Instazood is labeled &#8220;Poor&#8221; with a 2.5/5 star review. Sometimes this rating can be manipulated.</p>
<p>For example, if there are only a couple people reviewing the product and they both leave a bad rating then the overall rating will be terrible. That doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case here. At the moment, there are 231 reviews, and 44% of reviews gave it a one star review.</p>
<h3>Unstable Performance 👎</h3>
<p>One thing I noticed is the performance can be unstable and inconsistent at times. What I mean is sometimes the bot won&#8217;t work, or work incredibly slowly, and other times it will work very fast.</p>
<p>A lot of other users complain about this issue too, some of them even said the bot never worked for them, even after paying the monthly subscription.</p>
<h3>Complete Suite is Expensive 👎</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to buy the full suite of tools, the total will come to quite a bit. I wish there was a discounted subscription that combines all the services. While we&#8217;re on the subject of services, I think it&#8217;s kind of annoying to pay for so many different ones at the same time.</p>
<p>I also feel like some of the services are a bit too expensive for what they offer. For instance, the Comment Tracker is $9.99 a month. I can manage comments for free through the Instagram website or app.</p>
<h3>Customer Support is a Little Slow 👎</h3>
<p>Instazood claims their customer support usually replies to questions within 24 hours. But from what I could tell, it takes a lot longer than that.</p>
<p>Most of the people on the Trust Pilot page are unhappy with the customer support, which may be why they leave such negative reviews. Another thing to keep in mind is they don&#8217;t have phone or live-chat support &#8211; everything is done through email tickets.</p>
<h3>Reports of Instazood Locking Instagram Accounts 👎</h3>
<p>Seems like there are some cases of people getting locked out of their Instagram account after using this tool. The issue could stem from Instazood&#8217;s service, but it could have been caused by the users.</p>
<p>For example, one thing that can get your account locked, and that Instazood advises against, is using your account while the software is active.</p>
<p>Then again, the service could just be unreliable. To avoid issues, I recommend digging through the Instazood help archives and tutorials to make sure the fault is not on your end. Activating Night Pause is another way to avoid issues with Instagram. And switching to Slow speed is a good idea too.</p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>An official Instazood FAQ <a href="https://instazood.com/support/basics-faq/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">can be found here</a>, but we made our own unbiased one for you.</p>
<h3>Is Instazood Good?</h3>
<p>After testing out the tool and reading other people&#8217;s opinions online, I can say Instazood is a good enough bot. The service usually works as advertised, although you might run into some hiccups here and there. But the unstable growth littered with fake accounts can be bothersome. When it works, it works great, but it&#8217;s a fifty-fifty chance.</p>
<h3>Is Instazood Cheap?</h3>
<p>Yes, Instazood is cheap. As a matter of fact, the bot service is quite budget-friendly. It only costs <strong>$14.99</strong> a month and it includes a free three day trial. On the other hand, if you want to use all the other services, it costs quite a bit. Still, I like how you can choose to only pay for the services you need.</p>
<h3>Is Instazood Safe?</h3>
<p>The software itself is safe, but there are precautions you can take to beef up safety levels. For one, use your own proxies (if they&#8217;re from a trusted source). Next, use the anti-spam filters, such as: Skip 10% of Accounts, Night Pause, add appropriate limits, decrease speed, use good filters, and don&#8217;t use your account when the bot is active. Overall, Instazood is quite safe.</p>
<h2>Why Don&#8217;t We Recommend Instazood?</h2>
<p>Personally, I feel like the service is a little unstable. And, when compared to other bots, the growth isn&#8217;t that great. I noticed a lot of fake accounts in our followers, and the bot wasn&#8217;t even interacting with that many people. Look, Instazood isn&#8217;t a bad service, I would rank it somewhere in the middle, a neutral area, but it&#8217;s definitely not one of the best.</p>
<p>Wondering what are the best Instagram managers out there? I recommended two of our favorites, Kenji.ai, and Upleap, but there are others too.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing the wonderful world of social media automation.</p>
<p>Do you ever wish that you just had a few extra hours in your day?</p>
<p>No matter how hard you try, it may seem as though you can never really get a handle on your schedule. You&#8217;re always rushing from one task the next, with not enough time to breathe &#8211; never mind relax. On the one hand, you know that running a business or a marketing campaign is hard work. On the other hand, you also feel like it shouldn&#8217;t be as stressful or overwhelming as it currently is.</p>
<p>When time is scarce, it&#8217;s tempting to give up on social media entirely and tell yourself that you can get by without an Instagram campaign or a Twitter presence. However, the truth is that social media is the key to your success in the digital world. According to Statista, there <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">are 3.09 billion social media users</a> online today. That&#8217;s an audience that you just can&#8217;t ignore.</p>
<p>So, how do you handle your social media presence, and find enough time for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep each night? That&#8217;s where social media automation comes in.</p>
<h2>What is Social Media Automation?</h2>
<p>Social media automation tools come in many different formats, depending on what you want to do online. However, regardless of whether you choose an Instagram automation tool or a Twitter automation service, you can rest assured that all of these solutions will do the same thing &#8211; free up some of the time you spend online.</p>
<p>With social media automation, you use digital strategies to automate or semi-automate the tasks you complete on social media each day. This might include scheduling your posts ahead of when you <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/features/social-media-publishing/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">want to publish them</a> or responding automatically to customers in your DMs. Automating your social media publication, engagement, and management strategies can reduce the stress associated with an immersive online marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of social media automation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Save valuable time: Scheduling your posts in advance means that you have more time left over in your day-to-day schedule. You can use this for running your business, taking advantage of new opportunities, or planning future social content.</li>
<li>Engage your audience: Social media automation tools can automatically notify you whenever someone gets in touch with your brand. You can even use bots to let your customers know that you&#8217;ll get back to them asap, so they don&#8217;t lose interest.</li>
<li>Simplicity: Most automation tools are incredibly easy to use. They help you to get more control over your online strategy without hiring a social expert.</li>
<li>Business growth: The more consistent and active you stay on your social media channels, the more you&#8217;ll drive traffic to your brand and website.</li>
<li>Strengthen your brand message: Planning and automating your content allows you to send a more consistent message to your audience. With Instagram automation tools, you can even plan how your grid will look over time to improve your visual impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Can Companies Do with Social Media Automation?</h2>
<p>Although many people understand the basics of social media automation, they don&#8217;t know what they can do with an Instagram automation or Facebook management tool. There&#8217;s a common misconception in the marketplace that automation is all about making your social media strategy less of a hands-on experience. However, the truth is that automation is about giving you more time to maximize your online presence. It&#8217;s not about removing the human touch from your social media strategy entirely.</p>
<p>With a Twitter automation strategy, or <a href="https://medium.com/the-anatomy-of-marketing/my-top-ten-time-saving-social-media-automation-tools-ed6e2a1894c3" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">some other social media tool</a>, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule your posts according to the times that you know your audience is active online. This improves your chances of engagement and also helps you rise to the top of the Instagram Explore page too.</li>
<li>Curate content from the blogs your customers appreciate. Automation tools allow you to collect content from other brands and users and <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/repost-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">repost</a> it on your page (with their permission of course). This helps to expand the diversity of your profile.</li>
<li>Create custom responses for better customer service: With bots and automated tools, you can let your audience know that you care when they reach out online. Even if a human being isn&#8217;t available to answer their questions, you remind them that you&#8217;ll be around to help as soon as you can.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Limitations of Social Media Automation</h2>
<p>As valuable as social media automation can be, it&#8217;s not the answer to every issue you have with your online marketing campaigns. Ultimately, these tools are intended for improving the experience that your community has with your brand and boosting efficiency. You&#8217;ll still need your social strategy to have a human touch if you want to thrive in today&#8217;s marketplace.</p>
<p>Your automation tools can&#8217;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace meaningful conversations with your community or genuine responses to comments and questions sent by your tribe.</li>
<li>Keep posting the same content consistently without anything fresh or different. You might be able to use Instagram automation to post photos on your Insta profile, but you&#8217;ll still need to create videos, Live posts, and Stories with a human expert.</li>
<li>Create creative content on your behalf: It&#8217;s still up to you to find out what your customers want to see on your social media platforms and design the content that speaks to them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.     Later (for Scheduling)</h3>
<p>If the aim of your social media automation strategy is to make sure that you&#8217;re posting your content at the right time each day, then you&#8217;re going to need a scheduling tool. Later is an Instagram automation solution that also works with a host of other social media channels. This tool will allow you to load up your posts in advance, so you&#8217;re always ready to keep your profile looking fresh.</p>

<h3>3.     Kenji.AI (For an Automation Bot)</h3>
<p>These days, bots are some of the most incredible ways to get access to extra social media help, without having to invest in human intelligence. Kenji.AI is one of the most innovative Instagram bots on the market because it saves you from the stress of potentially posting dangerous content online. Kenji.AI uses artificial intelligence to determine what kind of hashtags you need to use, and what content you should be interacting with online.</p>
<p>Explicitly designed for Instagram automation, <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji.AI</a> goes beyond the basic features of standard bots to ensure that you&#8217;re making a real difference to your social media campaign. You won&#8217;t be just liking and commenting on things at random. Kenji.AI also allows you to track the performance of your campaigns over time through a simple and easy-to-navigate dashboard.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-936" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kenji-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kenji-300x221.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kenji.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>4.     Crowdfire (For Account Management)</h3>
<p>Crowdfire started as a simple app that users could access to track their unfollows on social media. Since it first emerged in the marketplace, however, this tool has grown into something so much more immersive. Not only can you use Crowdfire to view new unfollows and schedule content according to your specific needs, but you can also access daily advice from in-depth data analytics too. This means that you&#8217;ll always have ideas on how to take your campaign to the next level.</p>
<p>Crowdfire is excellent for cleaning up your social media strategies, ensuring you&#8217;re placing your content in front of the right people, and helping you to engage your audience. There&#8217;s a viral hashtag tool available, a photo suggesting tool for Instagram, and even in-depth Twitter automation with detailed stats and analytics.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-935" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CROWDFIRE-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="234" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CROWDFIRE-300x234.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CROWDFIRE.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h3>5.     IFTTT</h3>
<p>One of the best-known social media automation tools on the market today, IFTTT is a unique solution that gets your apps to communicate more effectively. IFTTT is an intelligent free tool that gives businesses and marketing managers the power to connect all of their most-used apps, tools, and platforms in the same environment. The central software works to align all of the apps that you use and allows you to create specific automation funnels or &#8220;recipes&#8221; that create chain reactions across your campaigns.</p>
<p>For instance, you might use IFTTT social media automation to automatically re-post any content from Instagram onto your Facebook channel whenever you add a specific hashtag to your scheduling app. You could also use the tool to automatically save everything that you publish on Instagram to Dropbox, so you can come back and use the same content again in the future for your Stories and other promotions if necessary.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-934" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IFTTT-300x175.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IFTTT-300x175.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IFTTT-768x449.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IFTTT.jpg 843w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Making the Most of Social Media Automation</h2>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that there&#8217;s more to social media automation than just downloading and using the right tools. Ultimately, automation can quickly become an addictive experience, particularly when it frees up so much of your valuable time. However, while automation tools can be very beneficial to today&#8217;s businesses, they can also be very dangerous if you don&#8217;t know how to use them properly.</p>
<p>Spend too much time with your Instagram automation and Twitter automation tools, and you could risk losing the respect and adoration of your fans on social media. After all, it&#8217;s essential to keep in mind that social media is designed to connect human beings. People don&#8217;t want to be constantly hearing from bots on their feeds.</p>
<p>Learn from examples like Acura Insider:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-933" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/acura-insider-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/acura-insider-300x300.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/acura-insider-150x150.jpg 150w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/acura-insider-60x60.jpg 60w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/acura-insider.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This company made the mistake of going too far with their Twitter automation. They started sending out invites to anyone using a specific hashtag, which didn&#8217;t make much sense when they were inviting people to an event in a specific location.</p>
<p>Not everything in your campaign should be automated.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to figure out how to walk the line between using human compassion and creativity in your social media campaigns and relying on bots for help.</p>
<h2>Finishing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Social media marketing automation is a powerful tool, but it&#8217;s something that all companies need to use with care. Before you start downloading all the automation tools you can find and setting up unique funnels for your campaigns, make sure that you know what you&#8217;re getting into.</p>
<p>Have a strategy for figuring out when you can use automation to enhance and improve your social media strategy, and when you need to start using human insight instead. Automation tools will never be able to replace human beings altogether, but they can at least help us to get more done.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chances are you landed on this review because you&#8217;re looking for more information about the Instagram bot known as Instavast.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re wondering if buying the tool is a good idea or if it&#8217;s a waste of money. In this Instavast review, I&#8217;ll do my best to answer those questions. When you&#8217;re done reading this review, you&#8217;ll know exactly what this tool can do for you.</p>
<h2>What is Instavast?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-821" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instavastscreenshot.jpg" alt="Instavast overview" width="600" height="619" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instavastscreenshot.jpg 737w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instavastscreenshot-291x300.jpg 291w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Starting with the basics, Instavast is an cloud-based Instagram automation tool. It claims that it can grow your Instagram account quickly and safely while completely on auto-pilot.</p>
<p>They claim it&#8217;s a complete suite of Instagram tools designed to grow your account with real followers and interactions. The platform includes several automation tools, as well as a few free services.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>Instavast is an Instagram bot, and it&#8217;s against Instagram&#8217;s rules to use a bot to manage your account.</p>
<p>Naturally, they can&#8217;t enforce the rule on everyone, but their anti-spam filters are well-tuned to detect suspicious account activity. There&#8217;s always going to be some risk involved with using an Instagram bot, so use them at your own risk.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting Started</strong></h3>
<p>Getting started with Instavast is very simple. Much like other social media bots, you need to add targets and settings. Once you set the targets, the automation services can be toggled from the dashboard.</p>
<p>Instavast offers the usual automation services (<em>Like, Comment, Follow, Un-follow</em>), as well as a couple new ones we&#8217;ll be discussing later on. Now let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the features included in this tool.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 1.84615; margin-top: 1.71429rem; margin-bottom: 1.71429rem; font-size: 1.14286rem;">Instavast Features</h3>
<p>Instavast has a good amount of features that you can use to automate activity and tasks to save you time. On the other hand, these services are nothing out of the ordinary. As a matter of fact, when it comes to Instagram automation tools, these services are quite basic. Although not bad, the services aren&#8217;t amazing either.</p>
<h3>Promotions</h3>
<p>Most of the automation services are listed under the Promotion tab, inside the Instavast dashboard. Here you&#8217;ll find the quick-toggle buttons for your growth-focused services.</p>
<p>These services include: Auto likes, follows, comments, and more. The services in this tab are designed to grow your account. You&#8217;ll also find the filters and their settings in this menu.</p>
<h3>Targets: Hashtags, Usernames, and Locations</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-824 size-medium" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instavastdashboard-212x300.jpg" alt="Instavast dashboard" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instavastdashboard-212x300.jpg 212w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instavastdashboard.jpg 505w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" /></p>
<p>On the platform, they call these filters Advanced Methods. They&#8217;re the first settings you&#8217;ll need to change to activate the bot. You&#8217;ll add hashtags, usernames of other accounts, and the locations of areas you want to target. Speaking of hashtags, this platform has a free service called &#8220;Hashtag Generator&#8221;.</p>
<p>To use the Hashtag Generator, either upload a photo, post a URL, or add a keyword. Once you do that, the tool will search for all relevant hashtags and send you a list of free hashtags. From here you can copy and paste the hashtags into your new Instagram post for a quick boost.</p>
<p>Another service I haven&#8217;t seen on other <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-bots/" data-wpel-link="internal">Instagram bots</a> is a language detection filter. The function is self-explanatory, it filters out users based on language. Personally, I find this filter quite helpful because I always end up with non-English speakers on my account, and it&#8217;s hassle to manually remove them from my account.</p>
<p>On closer look, I noticed there&#8217;s a Competitor tab. What this service does is track the audience of your competitors, to interact with similar accounts, so you can build a similar audience. It&#8217;s a cool way to keep up with your competition.</p>
<h3>Auto DM and Post Scheduler</h3>
<p>For the marketers who are reading this, you&#8217;ll be happy to know this tool includes an Auto Direct Message service. Auto DM services can be a great way to market your products or services. You can choose to have the messages sent to each new follower, all followers, and even non-followers. Very nice.</p>
<p>And, luckily, Instavast also has one of my favorite features when it comes to Instagram tools, a post scheduler. The post scheduler works seamlessly with your internet browser, and making it easy to copy and paste the hashtags from the free tool we mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>More importantly, with the post scheduler, you can schedule content to be published far into the future, so you can have content coming out when you&#8217;re asleep or away from your computer. Very convenient.</p>
<h3>Buying Likes and Views</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to add a quick boost to your content, Instavast has a service where you can buy likes and views.</p>
<p>One cool thing about this service is you can buy likes for future posts as well. In other words, there will always be someone liking the content you put out. You could schedule a post and then schedule likes for that post, and interesting feature I haven&#8217;t seen in many Instagram tools.</p>
<h2><strong>Is Buying Likes Safe? </strong></h2>
<p>Although Instagram won&#8217;t usually ban accounts that buy followers and likes, there is a chance that they&#8217;ll remove the likes or followers that you bought.</p>
<p>A small one chance, but risky nevertheless. There are a few reasons why buying Instagram likes can be a good idea. For more details, take a look at this article about <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-instagram-likes-the-best-tools/" data-wpel-link="internal">getting Instagram likes.</a></p>
<p>Overall, buying likes for your posts is generally safe, although it&#8217;s not the most recommended practice, at least not a long term one.</p>
<h2>How Much Does Instavast Cost?</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about money.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-825 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagrambottrial-1024x245.jpg" alt="Instavast pricing" width="1024" height="245" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagrambottrial-1024x245.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagrambottrial-300x72.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagrambottrial-768x184.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagrambottrial.jpg 1644w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Each Instavast service requires a separate paid subscription. Although some people appreciate the flexibility of having multiple subscription options, when you add up the prices, the total comes to quite a bit. It&#8217;s also a bit of hassle to subscribe to multiple memberships.</p>
<h3><strong>Prices:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Instagram Bot (automation) &#8211; $15/month.</li>
<li>Auto DM &#8211; $10/month.</li>
<li>Comment Tracker &#8211; $10/month.</li>
<li>Post Scheduler &#8211; $10/month</li>
</ul>
<p>The Instagram Bot is the suite of automation services; auto-like, auto-follow, and auto-comment. It also allows you to add filters to narrow down your audience. The other subscriptions are stand-alone services.</p>
<p>Currently, there&#8217;s no option to package together services. If you want the full experience, then you&#8217;ll need to buy each service, which comes to $45 a month.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the most expensive bot out there, that&#8217;s for sure. But there are definitely <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">cheaper alternatives</a>. I also can imagine it must be a bit bothersome to have five separate charges every month.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel like the Instagram Bot and the Post Scheduler are the most useful services, so when you subscribe to those two, the total would only be $25/month which is not bad.</p>
<p>The good news:</p>
<p>Instavast offers a three day trial on all of their services, so you can basically use the whole suite of tools for free, within the trial period. There&#8217;s one thing about the trial that bothered me, and we&#8217;ll talk about that in the cons section.</p>
<h2>Instavast Pros: What We Thought Was Great</h2>
<p>While researching and testing this tool, I noticed a few things that I thought were great.</p>
<h3>1. Set Custom Limits</h3>
<p>I always appreciate it when the users have the freedom to add their own limits.</p>
<p>Of course, this does mean some people are likely to forget to set any limits, enabling the bot to interact with as many people as it can. When this happens, Instagram will probably flag your account as suspicious.</p>
<p>Either way, users can customize the interaction limits on a wide range of actions, such as follows, un-follow, likes, comments, and views.</p>
<p>You can also set limits for the day or the hour. I always suggest keeping the limits low, especially when you first start using the bot. You can gradually increase the limits as your account grows.</p>
<p>Instavast has a guide on setting the recommended limits, <a href="https://instavast.com/faq/instagram-bot/instagram-rate-limits/#igbot_q9" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">take a look at it here</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Nice Collection of Free Tools</h3>
<p>Remember the hashtag tool we mentioned earlier? That was one of several free tools that Instavast offers users. These tools are public and completely free, anyone can use them, which is a nice gesture.</p>
<p>The list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hashtag Generator</li>
<li>Banned Hashtags</li>
<li>Instagram Downloader</li>
<li>Username to ID Converter</li>
<li>Local Proxy</li>
</ul>
<p>You can probably guess what most of these do. The Instagram Downloader allows you to download content, photos and videos, from Instagram, directly to your computer.</p>
<p>This can make it easy for you to quickly copy someone else&#8217;s posts and re-upload them under your account, with different hashtags and descriptions. It a grey-area tool, not the most ethical, but most of the posts on Instagram aren&#8217;t unique, anyways.</p>
<p>Tip:</p>
<p>Of course, you need to use common sense. Obviously, you wouldn&#8217;t want to re-post copyrighted images or brand posts without permission. There is a lot of content you can share without worrying about copyright issues, for example, motivational quotes.</p>
<h3>3. Post Schedule &amp; Post Management</h3>
<p>Granted, this is a paid service, but it&#8217;s worth talking about. It makes it very easy to not only schedule posts, but also edit media and manage content on your profile. Think of it like a post-management service. You can instantly upload something from your computer, schedule it, or save it as a draft for later.</p>
<p>There are also some other useful features, such as disable comments, add first comment, add a location, and buy likes. Overall, a neat little tool that makes managing Instagram posts from your computer a bit easier.</p>
<h3>4. Flexible Payment Plans</h3>
<p>Although I mentioned subscribing to multiple plans can be bothersome, I did like how you have the option to select the ones you want.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need a certain service, then you don&#8217;t need to buy it. In other words, you can save money by only selecting the services that you need. I thought that was nice. Top that off with the free 3-day trial and it looks like a good deal.</p>
<h3>5. Cheap</h3>
<p>If you only use one or two of the services, the total is quite cheap. For example, if you use the bot only, that&#8217;s $15/month which is great for the automated services included. Overall, the prices are reasonable.</p>
<h2>Instavast Con: What We Thought Wasn&#8217;t So Great</h2>
<p>And now let&#8217;s talk about the downsides of this tool.</p>
<h3>1. They Require Your Phone Number</h3>
<p>This is what I didn&#8217;t like about the free trial. For some reason, they require your phone number to start the trial. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why they need your number, but I can assume someone will call you. I don&#8217;t like the idea of handing out my phone number to random platforms online.</p>
<h3>2. Users Report Slow Performance</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is intentional to reduce the bot footprint, but it looks like the service performance is rather slow. Users reported the bot only followed a few people a day, and the growth is much slower than advertised. We&#8217;re talking about a couple of users followed a day here. Very slow.</p>
<h3>3. Low Engagement Rates</h3>
<p>It looks like the followers that you get with the tool don&#8217;t seem to interact with your content that much. Across the board, people who used Instavast say that the engagement rates are quite low.</p>
<p>As you probably know, the amount of followers you have doesn&#8217;t really matter unless they&#8217;re engaging with you. If Instavast can deliver followers, but they don&#8217;t engage, then it&#8217;s kind of pointless.</p>
<h3>4. Not the Best Customer Support</h3>
<p>While most Instagram tools have live-chat, phone, and email support, Instavast only offers email support. And, as we all know, it usually takes awhile for someone to reply to emails. This means when you run into a critical error, it will take awhile to get the support that you need.</p>
<h2>The Instavast Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Overall, Instavast is an okay Instagram management tool. It has a lot of features, that&#8217;s for sure, as well as some free ones that can be quite helpful. But it&#8217;s not something I can wholeheartedly recommend, mainly because of the cons mentioned above.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a good Instavast alternative, I recommend taking a look at Kenji. It&#8217;s a really cool Instagram management tool that can safely automate all your activities. Kenji uses AI to automate activity on your account, it&#8217;s an interesting technology, and it works quite well.</p>
<p>The best part is you can sign-up to Kenji for free, so there&#8217;s no risk involved. And you don&#8217;t need to share any personal information, either. <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Check it out here.</a></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Instavast review! Hopefully, now you have a better understanding of what the tool can offer you.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more information before you buy Bigbangram, you came to the right place. In this Bigbangram review, we&#8217;ll take a look at the bot, how it works, the services &amp; features, and if it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>Starting with the basics&#8230;</p>
<h2>What is Bigbangram?</h2>
<p>Bigbangram is <strong>an Instagram bot that automates a wide range of services, such as: auto-follow, auto-comment, auto-likes, and much more. </strong>On their website, they refer to the bot as an Instagram promotion tool. The bot works mostly online, although there is a version you can download and install on your computer.</p>
<h2>Is Bigbangram Legit?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to say Bigbangram is <strong>a legit Instagram bot</strong>. Their service seems to work as advertised, and you can certainly use their services to promote your Instagram account. It&#8217;s not a scam.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some things that you need to be aware of before you buy the tool, and we&#8217;ll discuss those later on. But when it comes down to it, Bigbangram is a legit tool with many satisfied users.</p>
<h2>Bigbangram Features</h2>
<p>Bigbangram offers a wide range of Instagram features. In addition to the automated activities we mentioned earlier, the tool also provides other services too, such as:</p>
<h3>Limits &amp; Customization</h3>
<p>When it comes to Instagram bots, it&#8217;s always important to make sure the bot doesn&#8217;t go a little too crazy and do more than it should. Instagram is constantly looking out for repetitive behavior, so you need to mix things up a little bit. The limits provide you with an easy way to limit the actions of the bot.</p>
<p>You can customize limits based on a 24 hour or one hour period. For example, you can tell the bot to follow a maximum of 200 people a day, or something along those lines. I always recommend putting the limits even lower than what the company recommends, to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about this tool is you can either choose a membership or subscribe to each service individually. For example, if you only want the auto-follow bot, then you can buy that bot and nothing else. It&#8217;s nice to see tools providing people with flexible options.</p>
<p>The memberships essentially package all the individual services into a monthly subscription, which ends up being a little cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>Speaking of memberships&#8230;</p>
<h3>Bigbangram Payment Plans</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-640 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bigbangramfeatures-1024x283.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="283" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bigbangramfeatures-1024x283.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bigbangramfeatures-300x83.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bigbangramfeatures-768x212.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bigbangramfeatures.jpg 1618w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>These prices are for the Instagram Promotion Bot, not the other services, which have their own prices.</p>
<p>There are four options; one dollar trial, Standard, VIP, and x6 High Speed Mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 &#8211; day trial, $1</li>
<li>Standard &#8211; $15/month</li>
<li>VIP &#8211; $85/month</li>
<li>x6 mode &#8211; Custom, starting at $22 a month.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, most people will settle for the trial and the Standard membership. The free trial includes most of the features that are in the other payment plans.</p>
<p>The main difference between the trial and the Standard is with Standard you can setup your first campaign for free. Most people will move to Standard when the trial expires.</p>
<p>You should know the VIP and x6 modes are custom, so you&#8217;ll need to reach out to the team to see if you qualify for these modes. But you can start the trial or Standard whenever you want.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice to have the option to try out the tool with a free trial. Bigbangram&#8217;s 3-day trial is includes access to pretty much all of the major services.</p>
<p>Overall, Bigbangram is an affordable Instagram bot. It&#8217;s actually one of the cheaper ones we had the pleasure of reviewing in a long time. The Standard membership at $15 a month is usually enough for most people to get that boost of activity their Instagram needs.</p>
<h2>Does Cheap Mean Low Quality?</h2>
<p>Since the price is low, it&#8217;s logical to assume the service quality will be low as well. It seems like most people have mixed opinions about Bigbangram. Some people say the platform is a scam and recommend avoiding it, while others say it&#8217;s incredibly useful.</p>
<p>There are arguments for both sides, and we&#8217;ll talk more about that in the downsides section. Overall, however, the quality seems to be good. If you take the necessary precautions, I don&#8217;t doubt the tool can be used to build your following on Instagram.</p>
<p>Having said that, there are some things you need to know about.</p>
<h2>Bigbangram Pros: What We Liked</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we liked about this Instagram bot.</p>
<h3>Plenty of Auto-Features 👍</h3>
<p>With Bigbangram you can get all the main auto features, such as likes, follows, un-follow, and comment. These are incredibly helpful for growing a following and saving you time. I also liked how you configure the limits of each service.</p>
<h3>Wide Range of Filters 👍</h3>
<p>Another great thing about this platform is it provides you with a wide range of filters. With the right configuration, it will be easy to build a highly targeted following on Instagram.</p>
<p>For example, there&#8217;s a gender filter, media age, skip private users, skip 10% of accounts, skip users with a certain number of followers or min posts, skip business profiles, and a lot more. You can also add users to the blacklist.</p>
<h3>Good Amount of Anti-Spam Functions (Safe!) 👍</h3>
<p>When it come sot Instagram bots, you&#8217;re probably worried that Instagram will ban your account. While this is a risk, the actual chances of it happening are quite low.</p>
<p>If Instagram detects strange activity on your account, it will ask you to reset your password. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s important to use a bot that has plenty of anti-spam filters, and Bigbangram has a few worth talking about.</p>
<p>For instance, night-mode. When night-mode is enabled, the bot will pause during the hours people are most likely to be asleep.</p>
<p>Additionally, there&#8217;s the <em>Skip 10% of Accounts</em> filter that also reduces spam-like activity. Combine those two features with manually-configured low limits, and Instagram will have no idea that you&#8217;re using a bot.</p>
<h3>Post Upload and Schedule Module. 👍</h3>
<p>I love it when a bot includes a service to schedule and upload posts. With the Instagram Schedule Post module, you can not only schedule and upload posts, but also upload videos and resize photos.</p>
<p>This module makes it easy to copy photos from your computer into your Instagram account, saving you a lot of time. The downside is this is an extra feature, not included in the bot subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/the-top-5-instagram-schedulers/" data-wpel-link="internal"><strong>P.S. Check out our post on top Instagram schedulers. </strong></a></p>
<h3>Direct Messaging Service 👍</h3>
<p>This feature allows you to either send a automated messages to new fans, based on the triggers you create. For example, you can send out mass-messages to all your fans, only new fans, and other users.</p>
<p>With this feature you can also manage direct messages and reply to incoming messages in seconds, from your computer. It&#8217;s a great service for sending out advertising new promotions and what not.</p>
<h3>Affordable Plans 👍</h3>
<p>As you may recall, the paid subscriptions are very affordable. There&#8217;s also the option to subscribe to one specific service only which is great.</p>
<p>Most people will choose the Instagram Promotion Bot which costs $15 &#8211; $85 a month and includes every service. The Standard plan only costs $15 which is crazy cheap for the services provided.</p>
<h3>Detailed Help Center 👍</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll be happy to know the platform does have a dedicated support center with plenty of tutorials on how to complete various tasks with the program.</p>
<p>For instance, they&#8217;ll walk you through how to create a promotion, the best (and safest) Instagram practices, how to add appropriate filters, and a lot more. The good news is anyone can access the help center. They even have a helpful chart to set your limits based on your account&#8217;s size.</p>
<p>But on the other hand&#8230;</p>
<h2>Bigbangram Cons: What Could Be Improved&#8230;</h2>
<p>Based on other user&#8217;s complaints and my own opinions, here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t like about the platform.</p>
<h3>Inconsistent Growth 👎</h3>
<p>Oddly enough, a lot of users complain that the bot stops delivering results after they pay for a subscription. It seems like (based on reviews) that the trial works great and shows growth, but once you upgrade, the growth stops there. Naturally, users are quite frustrated with this issue, because they paid for a service only to have it stop delivering results.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say what&#8217;s going on in these cases. It may be the platform&#8217;s fault, or it may be the user failed to properly configure the bot. Regardless, you should be aware of the issue. The good news is that most people who try out the trial seem to see good results.</p>
<h3>No Detailed Growth Reports 👎</h3>
<p>You would expect some growth reports such as new followers and what not, but this platform doesn&#8217;t provide many detailed reports.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they do track conversion rates, as well as the number of new followers and un-follows. But that&#8217;s it. I wish the tool would track more data. At least a graph showing the new followers over time would be nice.</p>
<h3>Multiple Individual Payment Plans 👎</h3>
<p>In the payment section we mentioned most services are included in the Instagram Promotion Bot. On the other hand, there are many other features, such as the posting module, that require separate subscriptions.</p>
<p>In other words, you have to subscribe to the bot, and the subscribe to whatever other service you need. When you combine the price of the bot and all the other services, it comes to quite a bit.</p>
<h4><strong>Here&#8217;s a list of the extra services: </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Instagram Direct Message &#8211; $9/month</li>
<li>Comment Tracker &#8211; $9/month</li>
<li>Posting Module &#8211; $13/month</li>
<li>Social Media Management $75/month</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also the option to buy packages of Likes or Comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these are extra services, and you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to use them, but they&#8217;re nice to have. Choosing services can be a bit complicated, especially from inside the member&#8217;s area.</p>
<h2>The Bigbangram Bottom Line</h2>
<p>To summarize our Bigbangram review, based on what I could see, and the other reviews found online, to me it looks like the platform is legitimate and useful. With the proper configuration, I can definitely see how this tool can help with Instagram growth.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a decent tool, but due to the downsides, it still doesn&#8217;t take our top spot in our recommended Instagram tools. The reasons are; the confusing user-interface, inconsistent results, lack of a proper reporting tool, and the complicated payment system.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for the absolute best bang for your buck, I recommend taking a look at our <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">recommended Instagram tools</a>. With our tools, you can rest assured your account will not only be safe but also see explosive and consistent growth.</p>
<p>Here, let me save you a click. If you&#8217;re looking for a great Instagram bot that can manage most of your online activities, <a href="https://app.kenji.ai/sign-up" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">I recommend Kenji.</a> The good news is you can create a free trial, no strings attached. Take for a test run, if you like it, upgrade. No pressure.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Bigbanram review and good luck.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this Jarvee review, we&#8217;ll be answering the question, &#8220;Is Jarvee Worth It?&#8221; and walk you through how the tool works, its features, and if there are any better alternatives.</p>
<p>Continue reading to learn if Jarvee is the right Instagram tool for you.</p>
<h3>What is Jarvee?</h3>
<p>First things first, Jarvee is a Windows-based Instagram automation software. You download it, install it, and use it on your computer like any other computer program.</p>
<p>When activated, Jarvee can complete a wide range of tasks on your behalf, making it easier for you to grow your Instagram account.</p>
<p>Many marketers swear this is the best tool for social media marketers. One thing you need to know is Jarvee works with many other social media platforms too, not only Instagram.</p>
<h3>Our Recommended Tools:</h3>
<p>I would like to take a moment to recommend our top recommended Instagram tools. For a full list of our best tools, <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">take a look at this article:</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Upleap is a really cool Instagram automation tool because they hire real people to work on your accounts for you. It doesn&#8217;t use any bots or scripts. Most social media marketers like Upleap because it&#8217;s much safer than other Instagram automation tools.</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">KENJI</a></h3>
<p>Another tool we recommend is Kenji, the world&#8217;s best Instagram bot. Unlike Upleap, Kenji is an Instagram bot, but it uses AI to complete daily tasks on your account. Although it is a bot, it&#8217;s one of the safest ones out there, and you can customize the speed and settings to avoid any risks.</p>
<p>Getting back to our Jarvee review&#8230;</p>
<h3>How Much Does Jarvee Cost?</h3>
<p>Currently, Jarvee offers a free 5-day trial with no credit card required. If you want to purchase the product after the trial, there are three payment plans to choose from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starter ($29.95/month)</li>
<li>Regular ($49.95/month)</li>
<li>Professional. ($69.95/month)</li>
</ol>
<p>For most people, the Starter membership is more than enough, although it does limit you to 10 social accounts. Nevertheless, that&#8217;s plenty!</p>
<h3>Is Jarvee Easy to Use?</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-509 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/addingprofiles.jpg" alt="" width="787" height="559" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/addingprofiles.jpg 787w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/addingprofiles-300x213.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/addingprofiles-768x546.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, Jarvee does have a learning curve. They have so many features and options!</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re not the most tech-savvy, there is a learning curve, and you&#8217;ll probably have to spend some time watching their tutorials to figure things out.</p>
<p>The good news is they have plenty of introductory tutorials, including videos on how to add social accounts, add target sources, recommended speed/limits, and whatnot.</p>
<p>Overall, the program has a learning curve, but if you take the time to figure things out, it should help with your marketing efforts.</p>
<h3>Adding a Social Media Account:</h3>
<p>The first thing that you&#8217;ll need to do is add a social media profile. To do this, click on the social profile tab, then add a profile, and follow the on-screen prompts.</p>
<p>Currently, Jarvee works with the following platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>Google Plus</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Pinterest</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
<li>Tumblr</li>
</ol>
<p>In this Jarvee review, we will focus on Instagram features. The available tools will vary depending on the social media platform you use.</p>
<h3>Jarvee&#8217;s Features:</h3>
<p><img class="wp-image-507 size-full aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jarveefeaturescreenshot.jpg" alt="" width="1237" height="628" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jarveefeaturescreenshot.jpg 1237w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jarveefeaturescreenshot-300x152.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jarveefeaturescreenshot-768x390.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/jarveefeaturescreenshot-1024x520.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1237px) 100vw, 1237px" /></p>
<p>Jarvee does have a lot of features and customization options. We won&#8217;t be discussing every single feature here, but we will cover the most important ones.</p>
<p>Inside the software, these features can be found in the tools menu. You&#8217;ll also see all the features that are available for your given social media profiles. You can toggle the services in this section too.</p>
<h3>What You Need to Know:</h3>
<p>Before getting into the features, there are a few things you need to know about this tool.</p>
<p>Remember, Jarvee is a bot. So to avoid the risk of being banned, it&#8217;s recommended to use a proxy whenever you use the software. You can use the software without a proxy, but if you want to connect multiple social media profiles, a proxy is highly recommended.</p>
<p>Another point to keep in mind is, do you need to download this program, install it, and have it open in order for it work on your behalf? It&#8217;s not one of those online-based tools that will run in the background. You have to have the program open on your computer to use the features.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the features.</p>
<h3>Follow and Unfollow</h3>
<p>Jarvee can automatically follow and unfollow accounts from your Instagram account (and most other social media platforms) based on your target settings. The follow tab has a wide range of options, and you&#8217;ll have to manually configure each one. What I like about this feature is you can customize the time and limits of almost every action.</p>
<p>For example, you can tell the tool to follow 2 or 10 people at a time, set a limit on the max followed accounts a day, set an amount to increase each day, randomize active times, and more.</p>
<p>You can also add more criteria such as whether or not the accounts have a profile picture, a bio, or uploaded something within a certain time frame. There are over 20 user-filters you can add.</p>
<p>Follow sources allows you to create criteria for the bot when searching for accounts to follow. For example, you can choose to follow people by keyword search, by friends of targets, by people from a list, and much more.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a night mode. With night mode, the campaigns will pause during specific hours. You can also enable randomize night-mode.</p>
<p>In other words, the follow tool is very in-depth and you can customize almost every little detail. It&#8217;s always great to have the option to change the settings on the follow tools, so you can make sure the bot isn&#8217;t performing to many actions on your account.</p>
<h3>Adding Destinations</h3>
<p>The destination service is quite useful because it sends content from one platform to multiple other destinations.</p>
<p>For example, if you publish something on your Instagram, you can create a destination to send that post to other platforms, such as a Facebook page, Facebook group, and whatnot. It makes sharing content over a network of profiles and platforms much easier.</p>
<h3>Schedule Posts</h3>
<p>if you&#8217;re away from your computer or you just want content coming out on a daily basis, scheduling posts can be incredibly helpful. With Jarvee&#8217;s post scheduling feature you can not only schedule regular Instagram posts but also stories. Very useful.</p>
<p>Another feature that is similar to this one is called <strong>Auto Re-post</strong>,  automatically copies posts from other profiles and uploads them on your profile.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t like the idea of posting content that is not original, but many social media marketers base their entire business on re-posting content.</p>
<h3>Automatically Leave Comments</h3>
<p>One more feature is the ability to leave custom-written comments on popular posts. You can choose to either rotate between a list of pre-written comments or use the spin Syntax to spin each comment into an original comment.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the spin Syntax makes a lot of mistakes, so if you value your brand&#8217;s reputation, I would go with the pre-written messages.</p>
<h3>After Follow</h3>
<p>Jarvee has a cool feature called After Follow which tells the bot what to do after you successfully follow an account.</p>
<p>There are several actions you can add here, but most people will settle for the Like Users Latest Post function. Here is a list of some of the other possible actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a number on how many posts to like.</li>
<li>Like a random post.</li>
<li>Leave a comment on the latest post.</li>
<li>Send a direct message.</li>
<li>Mute user.</li>
<li>Remove if the follow back ratio is lower than a certain amount.</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are quite a few ways we can use this feature for marketing online.</p>
<h3>Auto-Send and Manage Direct Messages with Jarvee</h3>
<p>Jarvee makes it easy for you to quickly reach out to new fans by auto sending direct messages.</p>
<p>The messages can be triggered a couple of ways. For instance, someone follows your account or someone sends you a message. You can also choose to automatically send people you follow messages.</p>
<p>The cool part is the software makes it really easy for you to manage messages as well.</p>
<p>You can delete undesirable messages, quickly reply to questions, and manage all of your conversations from your computer. No need to tire out your fingers tapping on a phone!</p>
<h2>Jarvee&#8217;s Downsides:</h2>
<p>Although Jarvee is one of the better social media management tools we reviewed, there are a few downsides worth talking about.</p>
<h3>Learning Curve, Not Easy to Use <span>👎</span></h3>
<p>For starters, there is a steep learning curve. Almost every feature has multiple tabs with settings and values you can change. Figuring out the best values for each setting is challenging!</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t feel bad if you can&#8217;t make sense out of all the menus and tabs right off the bat. Luckily, the company does have plenty of video tutorials to walk you through the initial steps.</p>
<p>Although the high level of customization is good in some ways, it also comes with some risks. For example, if you enter an extra zero or forget to add appropriate limits, Instagram might ban you.</p>
<p>There are no built-in limits, so your account could follow thousands of people in a matter of minutes, which will definitely set off some alarm bells.</p>
<p>In short, you need to be careful with your configurations. And remember to use a proxy!</p>
<h3>Only Compatible with Windows Operating System <span>👎</span></h3>
<p>For the people who use Macs for most of their work, I have some bad news. Unfortunately, Jarvee is only compatible with Windows.</p>
<p>Although that might seem like a deal-breaker, it is possible to install and run Jarvee on a Virtual Private Machine. Instructions on how to do that <a href="https://jarvee.com/knowledge-base/recommended-vps/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">can be found here</a>. But that&#8217;s another expense to add to the bill.</p>
<h3>Make Sure You Have Enough Power: <span>👎</span></h3>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is the program needs to be open and running in the background in order to work. And like other programs, this will likely take up most of your computer&#8217;s resources.</p>
<p>If you have a relatively modern computer with a decent amount of RAM and fast CPU it shouldn&#8217;t degrade performance. On the other hand, the more social accounts, the more resources required. If you have 10 accounts active on the program, you&#8217;ll need at least 4 GB of RAM.</p>
<h3>Jarvee Pros:</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we loved about this tool&#8230;</p>
<h3>Add 10 to 70 Social Accounts <span>👍</span></h3>
<p>One of the things I like about Jarvee is you can connect multiple accounts from other social media platforms. In fact, the limit on the Starter plan is 10 social accounts.</p>
<p>What this means is you can add accounts from other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and others, and have them running active campaigns at the same time.</p>
<h3>Decent Customer Support <span>👍</span></h3>
<p>Another upside is this tool has great customer support. Although they only offer email and ticket support, they do promptly reply to questions.</p>

<p>We also mentioned earlier that they have plenty of free video tutorials in the <a href="https://jarvee.com/knowledge-base/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">knowledge base</a> that makes it easy for beginners to start their campaigns. You can also contact support directly inside the software.</p>
<h3>Plenty of Configuration Options <span>👍</span></h3>
<p>Out of all of the Instagram automation tools I reviewed, this one probably has the most configuration options. It offers you total control, which is something I appreciate.</p>
<p>If you cherish your Instagram accounts, chances are you&#8217;ll want to make sure your campaigns are as human-looking as possible, and you can easily do that with Jarvee. Of course, it does take some time to figure out how everything works.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Is Jarvee Worth It?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, Jarvee is a great social media management tool, but it&#8217;s not the best for beginners. It&#8217;s designed more for advanced users, and there is a sharp learning curve.</p>
<p>It also has to run on your computer, which is a little bothersome, especially if it hogs the resources you would need for your other work. Nevertheless, all in all, I think Jarvee is worth trying out.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re looking for something that requires less of a time investment on your part, I recommend checking out Upleap or Jarvee. These two tools run entirely on their designated servers, can be accessed online, and you don&#8217;t need to worry about filling in mountains of information.</p>
<p>Everything is done for you.</p>
