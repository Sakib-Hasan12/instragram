								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Currently, there are over <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">25 million companies</a> worldwide using Instagram for business. With that many brands already signed up for a professional profile, it&#8217;s safe to say that there must be something valuable about this channel.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s the fact that more than <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">200 million users</a> visit at least one brand profile per day on Instagram. Or maybe it&#8217;s that Instagram encourages more engagement than any other social media platform, including Facebook.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasoning, Instagram has quickly emerged as the ultimate &#8220;home for brands&#8221; online, giving companies a unique environment through which to connect with customers. If you haven&#8217;t invested in an Instagram business profile yet, then there&#8217;s still time to discover the benefits for yourself.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s your guide on how to use Instagram for business.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Start with the Perfect Business Profile</h2>
<p>Your Instagram profile is the heart and soul of your social media strategy. It&#8217;s the first place that your visitors will come to learn about your company, peruse your content, and even get in touch with you. Keeping all of that in mind, it&#8217;s worth creating an account that speaks to your target audience.</p>
<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll need to do is make sure that you&#8217;re using an Instagram business profile, not just a personal account. <a href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-business-profile/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Business profiles</a> give you access to things like Instagram Insights for your analytics, paid advertising, and more. Although there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all strategy for designing your Instagram profile, here are some of the essentials that you&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A stunning profile picture: If you&#8217;re running a well-known company, then it makes sense to use your brand logo as your profile picture. For influencers and thought leaders, a smiley picture of you and your team is a good choice.</li>
<li>Account name: This should probably be the same as your business name, or identical to what you use on other brand profiles to make it easier for customers to find you.</li>
<li>Username: Again, this should be the same as your business name or your name. Avoid anything that might be difficult to find or spell.</li>
<li>Bio: This is where you need to explain the nature of your business to the people who visit your profile. Remember to have some fun with your bio by using space formatting techniques and emojis. You can also add relevant hashtags into the mix</li>
<li>Clickable URL: This is the single link you can have on your Instagram profile. Generally you&#8217;ll choose to link to your blog page or website product page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how @Ted&#8217;s Instagram profile is simple, straight to the point, and eye-catching. It uses everything from a professional profile picture to Stories highlights to stand out:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1131" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ted-300x133.jpg" alt="@TED profile " width="300" height="133" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ted-300x133.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ted.jpg 708w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Step 2: Take Advantage Of Instagram Business Profile Features</h2>
<p>Learning how to use Instagram for business means knowing how to take advantage of all the unique features you&#8217;ll get with your professional profile. For instance, when you sign up for an Instagram business profile, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact information: Upgrade your single link in your bio with a range of ways for users to connect you, such as an email address, phone number, and directions buttons situated at the top of your profile.</li>
<li>Business category: Give your followers an immediate insight into what you do with a business category. This sits just underneath your username and gives you an extra dose of credibility.</li>
<li>Call-to-Action buttons. Go into the <strong>Edit Profit </strong>option on Instagram and click on the <strong>Contact Options</strong> to add Call to Action buttons that allow followers to book appointments with you, buy tickets, or make reservations right within your profile.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Define Your Target Audience</h2>
<p>Before you can begin thinking about the kind of content you want to publish on your Instagram business profile, you&#8217;ll need to consider who your target audience is. Most of the people on Instagram today are under the age of 35, according to the <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-demographics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">latest demographic reports</a>. That means that you can expect to reach a relatively young range of consumers.</p>
<p>Of course, to know who you&#8217;re connecting with, you&#8217;ll need to take a closer look at your own audience analytics and user personas. If you&#8217;ve been using other social media platforms before Instagram, use your insights on those channels to find out who follows you on the web. You can also examine your competitors to see the kind of people that follow them. The chances are that you&#8217;ll be targeting a similar audience.</p>
<p>Once you understand who your target audience is, think about the kind of content they&#8217;ll want to see from your brand. Look at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lush/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">how Lush adheres to their audience</a>, for instance. Not only do they show off their latest products, but they also share information about their most recent CSR initiatives, because they know their customers are interested in protecting animals and the environment.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1130 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lush.jpg" alt="@Lush Instagram post" width="769" height="546" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lush.jpg 769w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lush-300x213.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lush-768x545.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<h2>Step 4: Establish A Posting Schedule</h2>
<p>Once you know who your audience is, it&#8217;s worth thinking about how often you&#8217;ll want them to see content from you. The more you use your Instagram business profile, the more you&#8217;ll learn about how frequently your audience get online, which will allow you to customize a schedule to their needs.</p>
<p>Start with general best-practice suggestions to get you started. For instance, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Unmetric and Hootsuite</a> offer a range of insights on the best times you should be posting on Instagram based on your industry.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your Instagram Insights page as you begin to post online and see what times of day you get the most engagement and interactions. Pay attention to any days when your engagement levels go up, and whether you start to lose followers if you post too many times or too few in one week. Finding the right schedule with Instagram for business requires a bit of trial and error. However, you&#8217;ll eventually find your sweet spot.</p>
<h2>Step 5: Establish A Style For Your Content</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve done your research and looked at some of the most popular accounts on Instagram up to now, you&#8217;ll notice that most of them have a consistent aesthetic that they adhere to with every post. This is something that you&#8217;ll need going forward as well. Followers on Instagram will expect a certain kind of content from you and your brand, so make sure you identify a theme for your material before you get started. Notice how chef <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dennistheprescott/?hl=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Dennis Prescott has created a style</a> for his Instagram that&#8217;s instantly recognizable and eye-catching.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1129 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dennistheprescott.jpg" alt="@DennisthePrescott instagram image" width="664" height="554" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dennistheprescott.jpg 664w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dennistheprescott-300x250.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></p>
<p>Remember, establishing a consistent style on Instagram for business doesn&#8217;t have to mean posting just one kind of content. Aside from your standard photos, you can also put your style into practice on things like Instagram Stories, a feature that appeals to more than <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iq/insights-to-go/250m-250m-people-use-instagram-stories-daily" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">400 million people</a> every day. Stories are a great way to interact with your audience through stickers, polls, gifs, and short video clips. You can even save your stories to your highlight reel to give your business profile more depth.</p>
<p>Other types of content to explore include Instagram video, which spans things like Instagram live for in-the-moment broadcasts, and IGTV for longer video content.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Don&#8217;t Overlook Your Captions</h2>
<p>For the most part, Instagram is a visual platform. That means that your customers are going to notice and appreciate the quality of your photos above all else. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean you should be neglecting your captions. Captions on Instagram are a place where you can showcase your unique brand voice and let your personality show through. You can also give meaning to your posts with captions, helping customers to form a connection to your brand.</p>
<p>To create compelling captions, you&#8217;ll need to develop a clear voice for your brand. Think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you should use slang or less common language in your posts</li>
<li>Whether your customers will like the use of emojis</li>
<li>What kind of personality and grammatical style will appeal to your audience</li>
<li>How you can add emotion to your content</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the posts from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.pokee/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mr.Pokee the hedgehog</a> for instance. The pictures are cute by themselves, but they also rely on some fantastic captions to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1128 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mr-pokee.jpg" alt="@MrPokee Instagram image" width="625" height="479" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mr-pokee.jpg 625w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mr-pokee-300x230.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h2>Step 7: Use The Right Hashtags</h2>
<p>Speaking of making the most out of your Instagram captions, make sure that you&#8217;re using hashtags to your advantage too. Instagram hashtags are how you make your online content easier to find. While the captions on Instagram aren&#8217;t searchable, the hashtags you use within them will boost your chances of placing your content in front of the right customers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to use hashtags, from making the most of trending tags like #TBT, to tagging your location with geotags. Whatever you do, make sure that you use a wide variety of hashtags to improve your brand reach. You can even create your own branded hashtags like #JustDoIt to boost your chances of earning user-generated content from your target audience.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to take advantage of niche hashtags too. For instance, while there are millions of posts under the tag #hairstyles, you&#8217;ll be able to reach a more specific selection of customers if you try to rank for the hashtag #MermaidHair instead:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1127 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mermaid-hair.jpg" alt="#MermaidHair search on Instagram" width="768" height="427" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mermaid-hair.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mermaid-hair-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<h2>Step 8: Engage Your Audience</h2>
<p>As customers do start to come your way on Instagram, it&#8217;s essential to make sure you&#8217;re taking advantage of your connections with them. It&#8217;s easy to forget this when you&#8217;re running a business, but social networks are all about the tribes and communities that you build.</p>
<p>To make your customers fall in love with your company, make sure that you spend as much time as possible interacting with them. Sometimes, this might mean launching an Instagram Live video broadcast where you can respond to common questions with a Q&amp;A session. Other times, it might just mean reaching out to relevant people in your industry by liking their content and leaving comments on their posts. Monitoring industry hashtags will make it easier for you to find the people you need to connect with.</p>
<p>Speaking of likes and comments, don&#8217;t be afraid to respond to the comments that people leave on your Instagram photos and videos too. If you can join in on the conversation that your customers want to have with you, then you&#8217;ll have a much better chance of earning their loyalty and compassion.</p>
<h2>Step 9: Pay To Play</h2>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s worth noting that most social media platforms, including Instagram for business, are becoming more reliant on the pay-to-play side of things. In other words, you might need to invest a little bit of cash into your Instagram growth strategy if you want to get ahead of the curve. Instagram Ads allow you to boost the reach of your targeted content using the highly advanced tools available through Facebook, Instagram&#8217;s parent company.</p>
<p>The great thing about Instagram for business ads is that there are a wide variety of different formats to choose from, based on what you know about your target audience and the kind of content they like most. From videos and stories to standard carousel posts, a little bit of paid advertising on Instagram could seriously boost your chances of success.</p>
<p>You could even take a unique route to your pay-to-play strategy and consider investing in Instagram influencers instead of standard ads. These are people who can share your content with your target audience and use their existing sway to help you grow online.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1126" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/allbirds-169x300.gif" alt="" width="169" height="300" /></p>
<h2>Using Instagram For Business</h2>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t started using Instagram for Business yet, don&#8217;t worry. There&#8217;s still plenty of time to start building a social strategy that will work for you and your brand. Instagram&#8217;s broad appeal and vast user base make it an excellent solution for companies in search of growth, as well as new opportunities to engage with their target audience.</p>
<p>Using the 9 steps above, you should have everything you need to start building a valuable presence for your brand on Instagram in no time.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram isn&#8217;t just a place where people share selfies and pictures of their food. This incredible social channel is also an excellent environment for businesses that want to build connections with their customers. 80% of <a href="https://business.instagram.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram users</a> say that they follow at least one company online. One of the easiest ways to make followers fall in love with you today is to give them something for free by running an Instagram giveaway.</p>
<p>Although many amazing Instagram marketing strategies have proven to be very effective over the years, giveaways are by far some of the best ways to build brand loyalty, attract new followers, and generate social buzz.</p>
<p>Although your company incurs a small expense when you give something away for free, the value you can earn in return is often astronomical.</p>
<p>So, how do you launch your first contest?</p>
<h2>Instagram Giveaway Rules: Staying On The Good Side Of &#8216;Gram</h2>
<p>The Instagram giveaway rules that you&#8217;ll need to follow whenever you&#8217;re launching a contest on the platform are pretty simple. For instance, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that everyone who followers your page understands that the competition isn&#8217;t tied to Instagram in any way.</p>
<p>Adding a small statement to your post that explains the details of your Instagram giveaway, and who can get involved (people over 13 usually), will save you from some legal repercussions.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need to make sure that you don&#8217;t ask your followers to tag themselves in your content or tag anything that doesn&#8217;t appear in the photo. Instagram penalizes users for this.</p>
<p>To reduce your risk of issues with your Instagram giveaway, take a look at <a href="https://help.instagram.com/179379842258600" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">the promotion guidelines</a> here.</p>
<h2>Instagram Giveaway Ideas: Contests To Run</h2>
<p>There are many different approaches that businesses can take to running an Instagram giveaway.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all strategy. You&#8217;ll need to consider what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish, and what sort of audience you want to reach with your competition before you get started. For instance, if you&#8217;re trying to grow your follower count, then it makes sense to use an Instagram giveaway that <a href="https://alextooby.com/instagram-giveaway/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">asks people to tag their friends or use a branded hashtag when they sign up</a>.</p>
<p>Some of your options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Like to win contests: These are the easiest options for your Instagram giveaway, as they require very little input from your audience. However, they&#8217;re not great for building engagement.</li>
<li>Tag a friend competitions: In this giveaway, you ask your followers to leave a comment and tag a friend to win. Tags improve your chances of reaching new customers and followers.</li>
<li>Post a selfie or picture: In this kind of Instagram giveaway, you can ask followers to post a picture that&#8217;s relevant to your brand, such as an image of them wearing or using your product. This is a great way to collect user-generated content for social proof.</li>
<li>Share this post: In these kinds of giveaways, you ask people to share your post and tag you with a branded hashtag to enter the contest. This is another relatively simple approach, but it requires more work from the audience than a simple like to win contest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have an idea of the kind of Instagram giveaway you&#8217;re going to use, then you can start to build out a plan for your competition. The following steps will help.</p>
<h2>1.     Choose A Goal For Your Instagram Giveaway</h2>
<p>The first step of running a successful contest is knowing what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish. After all, that&#8217;s the only way to make sure that your efforts are driving the right results. The goal that you want to accomplish will also determine what kind of contest you run.</p>
<p>For example, if you just want to generate more engagement on your posts, then you can simply run a like-to-win or comment-to-win contest. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re going to produce user-generated content, it&#8217;s better to ask people to publish photos or videos with a branded hashtag.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vikingbooks/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@Vikingbooks</a> launched an Instagram giveaway to improve their social following.  They asked followers to leave a comment to promote engagement and tag their friends in their post too.</p>

<h2>2.     Choose A Prize For Your Instagram Giveaway</h2>
<p>Next, once you understand what you&#8217;re going to (hopefully) get out of your giveaway, you can think about what your audience is going to get out of the deal too. Remember, your prize needs to be compelling enough that it will convince people to enter, but you don&#8217;t want to spend a fortune either. The size of the prize needs to match the amount of effort you&#8217;re asking people to put into getting involved.</p>
<p>A simple like-to-win Instagram giveaway might reward people with a free giftbag. On the other hand, if you want people to create custom content for your brand, then you&#8217;re going to need to give them something with significantly more value.</p>
<p>Make sure you choose a reward that&#8217;s relevant to your industry too. It doesn&#8217;t make much sense for a cosmetics company to give away some free clothes (unless they&#8217;re partnering with another brand). However, a giveaway of trending makeup items would be a great prize.</p>
<h2>3.     Outline Your Instagram Giveaway Rules</h2>
<p>The entry criteria for your Instagram giveaway depends on several factors. You&#8217;ll need to pay close attention to the Instagram giveaway rules that every brand has to follow. However, you&#8217;ll also need to think about what you want to accomplish with your new campaign. For instance, if you want to spread brand awareness, then you might just ask participants to like your post and comment with the name of a friend who they&#8217;d like to share their prize with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to draw attention to another page on your website, your blog, or your product page, then you might ask your participants to go to the link in your bio to enter the competition. You can even ask your followers to go and get the answer to a question from your blog and send it to you in your DMs for a chance of winning.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve partnered with another brand or influencer in exchange for using one of their products as a prize, like @Birchbox did below, then you might want people to follow the other brand as part of your Instagram giveaway rules.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-958 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Birchbox.png" alt="Birchbox Instagram giveaway rules" width="839" height="503" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Birchbox.png 839w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Birchbox-300x180.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Birchbox-768x460.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px" /></p>
<h2>4.     Select A Campaign Hashtag</h2>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re trying to spread brand awareness with your Instagram giveaway or not, it makes sense to get as much value as possible out of your campaign. On Instagram, hashtags help your content to appear more frequently on Explore channels. Additionally, the more you use hashtags, the more likely you are to connect with new people who will be interested in the content and products you have to share. The campaign hashtag that you choose needs to be exclusive to your campaign, so make sure that no-one else is using it before you get started.</p>
<p>The best hashtags:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature your brand name</li>
<li>Are short, simple, and easy to remember</li>
<li>Include the words &#8220;win,&#8221; &#8220;contest&#8221; or &#8220;giveaway.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>A great way to gather valuable content from your giveaway is to ask people to share a picture of them using your product, along with a branded hashtag.</p>
<h2>5.     Launch And Promote Your Contest</h2>
<p>Once you have your Instagram giveaway rules ironed out, you can launch your contest and start gathering as much feedback from your customers as possible. Remember, you&#8217;ll need to promote your giveaway as much as possible to get plenty of entrants. Think about partnering with influencers and other companies to improve your chances of success. Additionally, cross-promote your Instagram competitions on Facebook and other social pages whenever you can.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s helpful to put a time limit on your contest too. This will let people know that they only have a certain amount of time to get involved. This also means that your followers will be less likely to dither over whether they should enter or not. FOMO is a powerful motivator on social media. No-one wants to feel as though they&#8217;re missing out, particularly when they have the chance to win something for free.</p>
<p>As you move closer towards your deadline, remind your followers that time is running out with new posts that feature your competition hashtag.</p>
<h2>6.     Be Prompt About Picking A Winner</h2>
<p>Finally, make sure that you pick a winner for your contest as soon as you reach your deadline. If you&#8217;ve successfully generated a lot of excitement about your Instagram giveaway, then people will be waiting with bated breath to see who won.</p>
<p>The last thing you want is for people to question whether you&#8217;re as reliable as you claim to be when you fail to hand over the prize that you promised. Use a random Instagram giveaway picker (we&#8217;ll talk you through some below) to choose someone entirely without prejudice. If possible, look for an app that allows you to publish a secure and non-editable certificate of validity whenever you choose a winner.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-957 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EASY-company-clothing.png" alt="Instagram giveaway winner announcement" width="934" height="599" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EASY-company-clothing.png 934w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EASY-company-clothing-300x192.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EASY-company-clothing-768x493.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px" /></p>
<p>A great way to boost engagement and improve your brand&#8217;s reputation is to ask your winner to give you some additional content to publish when they receive your prize. Ask them to share a video or photo with an &#8220;unboxing&#8221; of their winnings. This will help audiences to trust that you&#8217;re going to give them a prize if they get involved with your Instagram competitions.</p>
<h2>Keeping Competitions Fair With Instagram Giveaway Pickers</h2>
<p>One of the biggest issues that businesses have when they run an Instagram giveaway is that it&#8217;s often challenging to convince followers that your choice of winner was utterly objective. If you want to avoid any complaints in your comments or even angry messages to Instagram, use an Instagram giveaway picker. These are tools that allow businesses to select someone entirely at random. For instance, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a free number generator: If you have 400 entries for your Instagram giveaway, user a random number generator pick a number between 1 and 400. This means that you&#8217;ll have to count to the right number chosen by the generator, but it&#8217;s a simple enough process. You can even find a generator by merely typing &#8220;Random number generator&#8221; into Google.</li>
<li>Use a random name picker: Similar to a random number picker, a random name picker allows you to enter all of the names of your entrants into a digital tool. You&#8217;ll need to create a spreadsheet of names to do this, which can be quite tedious. However, if you&#8217;re listing your winners anyway &#8211; perhaps so you can follow them later, then this could be the best option for you.</li>
<li>Use an Instagram giveaway picker app: If you want something that requires a little less work on your part, then you can use a tool like the <a href="https://www.easypromosapp.com/instagram-sweepstakes/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">EasyPromos app for Instagram Sweepstakes</a> and competitions. This app allows you to filter finalists based on the number of friends they&#8217;ve mentioned and so on. The app automatically chooses a winner on your behalf, and it also provides a certificate of validity that promises followers that the draw has been entirely random. The certificate is white labelled, which means that you can add your own branding.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making The Most Of Your Instagram Giveaway</h2>
<p>A great Instagram giveaway isn&#8217;t just an exciting way to boost your follower count and generate buzz for your brand. If you use your competitions correctly, they can also provide you with a vast amount of information that you can use for future campaigns. For instance, if you track the results of your contests on Instagram insights, you&#8217;ll be able to see what kind of competitions promote the most attention for your company or drive the best engagement.</p>
<p>Remember, the majority of Instagram giveaways aren&#8217;t going to go instantly viral and generate huge results overnight. Your first contests might only get a handful of participants. However, the more you grow your following, prove your credibility, and learn how to use Instagram to your advantage, the more valuable your competitions will become.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you using Instagram polls yet?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been searching for a reliable way to engage your audience and drive results for your social media campaigns, then you can&#8217;t go wrong with Instagram Stories. These days, people love Stories because they help them to learn more about a brand, interact with a company, and see behind the scenes of their favourite organizations.</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/730315/instagram-stories-dau/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">500 million stories</a> are posted on Instagram every day. What&#8217;s more, 50% of brands already say that they use Instagram Stories to connect with customers.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re one of those brands that already rely on Instagram Stories, or you&#8217;re just on the verge of getting started, it&#8217;s important to make sure that you know how to use all of Instagram&#8217;s exceptional features to your advantage. For instance, Stories aren&#8217;t just a place to share exciting content with your followers; they can also be an environment for launching engaging conversations, or even learning more about your audience.</p>
<p>All you need to do to tap into the true potential of Stories is learn how to make a poll on Instagram. Fortunately, we&#8217;re here to help.</p>
<h2>How To Make A Poll On Instagram</h2>
<p>Like most Instagram features, Polls are designed to help you engage with your audience.</p>
<p>Rather than just throwing content at your followers and hoping they&#8217;ll respond with likes and comments; you actively boost your chances of engagement by asking enticing questions. For instance, you might ask which of your top-selling products your customers like best, or how they feel about a trending discussion.</p>
<p>Polls only allow you to give people one of two options to choose from when they&#8217;re answering your questions. However, that&#8217;s still enough to provide you with some valuable insights into what your audience is thinking. So, here&#8217;s how to make a poll on Instagram.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap on the stickers icon in the top right of your screen &#8211; the thing that looks like a peeling smiley face</li>
<li>Tap on the Polls icon (This says &#8220;Poll&#8221;)</li>
<li>Add your questions and the responses that your audience can choose from. The default is &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No,&#8221; but you can get creative and use emojis or customized text too.</li>
<li>Publish your poll and wait for the results</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1093" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poll-289x300.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="300" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poll-289x300.jpg 289w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/poll.jpg 316w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /></p>
<p>Your Instagram poll will last for 24 hours-  just like a standard Story. However, you can always keep it alive for longer by adding it to your Stories Highlights reel too.</p>
<h2>Getting The Most Out Of Your Instagram Polls</h2>
<p>Instagram polls work best when you use them to target a specific goal or outcome.</p>
<p>For instance, if you aim to increase engagement, then you might just use your Instagram poll questions to get people talking about a trending topic. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re trying to drive referrals to your website, then you might ask your audience members to &#8220;swipe up&#8221; on your poll to visit your website and get extra information.</p>
<p>Additionally, it&#8217;s worth noting that like other aspects of your Instagram Stories, you can also gather useful analytical insights from your Instagram polls.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://metricool.com/create-instagram-polls/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">tapping into your poll</a>, you&#8217;ll be able to see how many people saw your survey, and who viewed it too &#8211; just like you can with Instagram Stories. You&#8217;ll also be able to gather useful insights from your poll results which could help you with planning future content campaigns.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can use your Instagram poll questions to ramp up your social media strategy.</p>
<h2>1. Source Customer Feedback</h2>
<p>Want more insights from your target audience? Instagram poll questions are a great way to get them. If you&#8217;re looking for information on how your audience feels about your products, or what they&#8217;d like to see you produce next, then the best way to learn is to speak to your customers. Instagram Stories polls are an excellent tool for businesses that want to collect feedback, ideas, or inspiration.</p>
<p>For instance, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask your customers whether they love or hate your new dress design</li>
<li>Get votes on what your next product should be</li>
<li>Have people choose their favorite version of a new product before it rolls out</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting insights from your audience is excellent for making sure that you&#8217;re investing in the products and ideas that are most likely to generate value for your brand. For instance, influencer and celebrity hairstylist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenatkinhair/?hl=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Jen Atkin</a> used polls to get her audience&#8217;s opinions on features that she would later include in her new line of luggage items:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1092" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jenatkin-173x300.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="300" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jenatkin-173x300.jpg 173w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jenatkin.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 173px) 100vw, 173px" /></p>
<p>If your audience feels as though they&#8217;ve had a hand in building a new product, they&#8217;re far more likely to want to buy it when it&#8217;s available in-store. What&#8217;s more, they&#8217;ll respect your company more because they&#8217;ll see how much you value their input and ideas.</p>
<h2>2. Drive Website Traffic</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a good chance that there&#8217;s more to your social media strategy than a simple Instagram campaign. You&#8217;ll probably want to drive traffic back to your website too. After all, that&#8217;s likely where your products and purchasing options live. Fortunately, Instagram added the option to include links in your Instagram <a href="https://later.com/blog/add-links-instagram-stories/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Stories way back in 2017</a>. That means that you can cross-promote your site with relative ease. Since links in Stories first emerged, brands of all sizes have been taking advantage of them.</p>
<p>Take a look at this Story shared by the Who What Wear team, for instance. The company wanted to drive more customers back to their website where they could see the latest articles on trending fashion news. To do that, the company created a Story that asked How much Meghan Markle&#8217;s tour wardrobe cost. When people swiped up for the answer, they were directed back to the <a href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Who What Wear website</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1091" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/whowhatwear-300x267.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="267" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/whowhatwear-300x267.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/whowhatwear.jpg 595w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>This was a fantastic opportunity for the brand to show their customers that they had diversity to offer in their content, and it allowed them to attract consumers from different backgrounds too.</p>
<h2>3. Show Off Your Product Catalog</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re already active on Instagram, then there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ve got some visual products that you want to show off to the world. One of the best ways to do that is to implement your products into your Instagram polls. For instance, leading Swedish furniture company, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ikeausa/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">IKEA USA</a>, used their Instagram poll questions to ask users how they felt about certain kitchen products and items, all while showing off their latest range.</p>
<p>By combining their product portfolio with an Instagram poll strategy, Ikea was able to gather useful information about the kind of items their audience was looking for, while simultaneously promoting their wares.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1090" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ikea-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ikea-300x260.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ikea.jpg 609w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>At the same time, the poll structure also meant Ikea&#8217;s pictures seem less blatantly advertorial than they might have done if they were just placed alongside the other content on Ikea&#8217;s feed. In a world where customers are less likely to enjoy being directly &#8220;sold at,&#8221; this subtle approach works wonders.</p>
<h2>4. Get to Know Your Audience</h2>
<p>Engagement is a crucial part of any marketing campaign today. If you want your audience to fall in love with your brand and keep coming back for more, you need to get them engaged. One of the best ways to do that is to get to know the people that are following you as well as possible.</p>
<p>Asking your customers questions about what they like and dislike about you, your products, brand, or industry, is a great way to gather information for future campaigns. The more you learn, the easier it will be to build strategies for advertising that will appeal to your target customer in the future. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would they rather see pictures or videos on Instagram?</li>
<li>Do they like a specific color more than another?</li>
<li>What kind of style are they looking for?</li>
<li>Do they want Q&amp;As or How-To videos?</li>
</ul>
<p>The swimwear brand, Mimi Hammer, gave an excellent example of how you can use an Instagram Poll to learn about your audience by asking customers what sort of designs they preferred most. Although the company was just sending out a customer survey, the playful format made it easier for them to gain real data from their target audience.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1089" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mimi-hammer-300x264.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="264" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mimi-hammer-300x264.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mimi-hammer.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Most people would prefer to respond to an Instagram poll than fill out a form sent via email or click on a link distributed to their smartphone.</p>
<h2>5. Enlighten Your Audience</h2>
<p>Usually, whenever a company decides to follow or interact with a brand online, it&#8217;s because they believe that they&#8217;re going to get some value in return. That value might come in the form of entertainment, insights, or even useful information.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of company that wants to be known as a thought leader in your industry, then Instagram Polls can be an excellent way for you to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/headspace/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">share your knowledge with your followers</a>. For instance, one of the world&#8217;s leading meditation apps, Headspace, used their Instagram poll questions to educate their users about mindful eating practices:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1088" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mindful-eating-300x260.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="260" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mindful-eating-300x260.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mindful-eating.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Remember, although learning how to make a poll on Instagram can be a great way to gather information from your audience, it can also be a good way to give knowledge back too. The more value your clients get from your brand &#8211; even on social media, the more they&#8217;ll want to interact with you in the future.</p>
<h2>6. Entertain Your Audience</h2>
<p>Aside from educating your audience, you can also use your Instagram poll questions to provide your followers with some casual entertainment. After all, the majority of the people you interact with on Instagram will be looking for just a fun way to spend the time. If they can rely on you to give them a bit of extra entertainment when they&#8217;re browsing through their newsfeed, they&#8217;ll be more likely to fall in love with your company.</p>
<p>Additionally, being entertaining with your Instagram polls is also a chance for you to show off your personality with a human approach that goes beyond the basic corporate image that most businesses have to share. For instance, Fan Club Clothing entertained their audience and got them engaged by asking them where they&#8217;re more likely to plant their fan-club flag &#8211; with David or Debbie:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1087" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fan-club-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="235" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fan-club-300x235.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/fan-club.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Ask yourself whether you can host any fun games or competitions through your Instagram Stories that will get people excited about checking your page for updates. The key to success, the Fan Club Clothing example shows, is thinking about the kind of content that&#8217;s most likely to appeal to your audience and keeping it relevant. Don&#8217;t just jump on a bandwagon because other people are doing it if it doesn&#8217;t make sense for your business.</p>
<h2>7. Have Some Fun With An Emoji Slider</h2>
<p>Finally, remember that using Instagram polls to have some fun and interact with your audience doesn&#8217;t have to mean asking them a bunch of basic yes or no questions. Instagram recently updated their poll offering to ensure that you can get even more information from your target audience with Emoji sliders.</p>
<p>A slider allows you to give your customers a more comprehensive range of options on how to respond to a particular question. For instance, if you&#8217;re trying to gauge a general feeling towards your new product line, you could ask people how much they &#8220;love&#8221; your new collection and allow them to slide an Emoji heart from a scale of 0 to 100.</p>
<p>Environmental <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oceana/?hl=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">company Oceana</a> combined fun with education with their approach to Instagram poll questions, by using an Emoji slider to ask followers how much food they think a manatee could eat in 24 hours:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1086" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/manatees-178x300.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="300" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/manatees-178x300.jpg 178w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/manatees.jpg 323w" sizes="(max-width: 178px) 100vw, 178px" /></p>
<h2>Making The Most Of Instagram Polls</h2>
<p>These days, there are plenty of new and exciting ways that you can interact with your audience through stickers and polls on Instagram stories.</p>
<p>However, learning how to make a poll on Instagram is just the first step. You&#8217;ll also need to make sure that you&#8217;re making the most out of your campaign by asking questions that resonate with your audience. Use our ideas above to transform your social media strategy by conversing with your target audience.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will switching to an Instagram business profile be beneficial for your brand? If you want to grow your account, the answer is yes!</p>
<p>There are over 25 million business profiles on the platform. However, some brands are hesitant to make the switch for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>How it might affect their profile</li>
<li>The risk of dropping engagement rate</li>
<li>Growing competition</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is plenty of evidence suggesting that switching to an Instagram business account is beneficial.</p>
<div id="attachment_1074" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1074" class="size-full wp-image-1074" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1141.jpg" alt="Instagram business profile sample" width="750" height="807" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1141.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1141-279x300.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1074" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: For Love and Lemons via @forloveandlemons</p></div>

<li>Ability to schedule and automatically publish posts.</li>

<p>Remember, you need to have Admin access to a Facebook page.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You&#8217;ve successfully switched to Instagram business profile.</p>
<h2>Best Instagram Business Profile Features</h2>
<h3>Access To Instagram Insights</h3>
<p>This is the main reason why brands need Instagram for business. Instagram insights provide data on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>Profile views</li>
<li>Impressions and reach</li>
<li>Audience demographics like gender, age, active hours</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1052" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1136.jpg" alt="Instagram Business Profile Insights sample" width="750" height="1188" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1136.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1136-189x300.jpg 189w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1136-646x1024.jpg 646w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Instagram insights present data in simple charts. This way, you can quickly evaluate your performance. This feature is great, but at some point, you&#8217;ll need more data.</p>
<p>For instance, you want to track your top-performing posts. Or you might need competitive analysis. If so, you&#8217;ll need additional tools to manage Instagram profile. We&#8217;ll discuss these tools later.</p>
<p>But the point is, if you switch to an Instagram business profile, you&#8217;ll be able to connect your account to third-party tools. In doing so, you&#8217;ll have access to additional reports and analytics.</p>
<h3>Run Instagram Ads and Promote Posts</h3>
<p>Growing your brand means reaching a wider audience. One of your options is to advertise your products or services on the platform. In doing so, you&#8217;ll get your brand message in front of your target market.</p>
<p>With over a billion active users, Instagram is an excellent advertising channel. In fact, brands are enjoying huge success in running Instagram ads.</p>
<p>Take a look at how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oreo/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Oreo</a> used Instagram ads to promote the new Cadbury Coated Oreo!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1053" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1110.jpg" alt="Instagram Business Profile Instagram ads sample" width="750" height="1186" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1110.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1110-190x300.jpg 190w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1110-648x1024.jpg 648w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Another option is to promote posts. How does this work?</p>
<p>Think of it like boosting a post on your Facebook Page. Simply choose which photo or video to promote. Tap the Promote button.</p>
<h3>Add Contact Details</h3>
<p>With an Instagram business profile, you can add contact information. This is different from your website link in the bio section. You can include any or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direction to your store</li>
<li>The phone number which opens the phone&#8217;s calling function</li>
<li>An email address which opens the mail app to compose one</li>
<li>&#8220;Message&#8221; option so users can DM your account</li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Links To Stories</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re probably aware that you can&#8217;t add clickable links to Instagram posts. You can only do so in your bio section.</p>
<p>However, if you use Instagram for business, you can add a link to Instagram Stories. But here&#8217;s the catch: You need to have over 10K followers.</p>
<p>Why do you want to use this feature?</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps drive traffic to your website</li>
<li>If you have an affiliate link, you&#8217;ll be able to earn a commission</li>
<li>You can quickly point your audience to where they need to take action</li>
</ul>
<p>Take this Instagram Story from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/figleavesofficial/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@figleavesofficial</a>. They used the Swipe Up feature to direct their audience where they can claim their code.</p>

<h3>Brand Content Approval</h3>
<p>With an Instagram business account, you can indicate who can tag you as a branded content partner.</p>
<p>Why is this useful?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instagram hashtags are a vital part of any user&#8217;s marketing strategy. As such, one must familiarize themselves with the limits, tactics, and varying practices involved with this feature of the platform. Below, we explore the effective use of hashtags (particularly optimizing the Instagram hashtag limit), and how one can successfully implement these for better reach and profile growth.</p>
<h2>First Off, What Are Instagram Hashtags?</h2>
<p>Instagram hashtags are used on posts to categorize them in to their appropriate niches. For example, a fitness influencer will likely tag their posts with terms such as &#8220;#gymjunkie&#8221;, &#8220;#healthyliving&#8221;, and &#8220;#bodybuilding&#8221;. Each hashtag has its own page on the app, displaying all posts that include it in the caption.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1023" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-symbol-pencils.jpg" alt="Hashtag symbol pencils" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-symbol-pencils.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-symbol-pencils-300x165.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-symbol-pencils-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Anyone looking for fitness-related content will likely search these tags on the app, helping them discover the user&#8217;s posts.</p>
<h2>Why Should We Use Instagram Hashtags?</h2>
<p>Instagram hashtags can offer greater engagement, reach, and brand awareness when used effectively. Studies show that hashtags can increase engagement by up to <a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">12.6%</a>, with longer hashtags offering even greater results. This is because they aid in a user&#8217;s content search, sorting them into their respective niches to capture the appropriate audience interest.</p>

<p>Hashtags also help in promoting your brand and encouraging audience interactions. Plenty of business accounts create &#8220;branded hashtags&#8221; &#8211; establishing a hashtag feed <em>specifically </em>for their content. By encouraging followers to use these same hashtags, they&#8217;re not only boosting engagement with their brand, but also spurring user-generated promotion.</p>
<p>Users now have the ability to follow specific hashtags. This makes them all the more useful in raising your content visibility.</p>
<h2>What is the Instagram Hashtag Limit?</h2>
<p>Users can use Instagram hashtags for both standard posts <em>and </em>Stories. For standard post captions, Instagram <a href="https://www.hopperhq.com/blog/instagram-hashtags-guide/#targetText=Instagram%20limits%20users%20to%2030,limit%20is%2010%20per%20Story." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">allows a maximum of 30 hashtags.</a> Stories have a much more restrictive limit of 10 hashtags per story.</p>
<p>Those who attempt to go beyond the Instagram hashtag limit will find their caption completely removed upon posting. (The photo/video will still post as normal, just with an empty description). When adding more than 10 hashtags to a story, it may not post altogether.</p>
<h3>How to Hide Story or Caption Hashtags</h3>
<p>As useful as they may be, users often find hashtags to clutter or ruin the overall aesthetic of a photo, video, or story.</p>
<p>To continue reaping the benefits of hashtags, while keeping your standard posts as &#8220;tidy&#8221;-looking as possible, many opt to separate their tags from their main caption with a series of dots.</p>
<div id="attachment_1025" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1025" class="size-full wp-image-1025" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-in-post-jessicakisiel.png" alt="Hiding your Instagram hashtags in a post (@jessicakisiel)" width="1000" height="642" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-in-post-jessicakisiel.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-in-post-jessicakisiel-300x193.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-in-post-jessicakisiel-768x493.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1025" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of jessicakisiel (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Simply type in a single dot or period, hitting &#8220;Enter&#8221; after each one. After repeating this about five times, you can then paste in your list of hashtags.</p>
<p>While stories have their own hashtag &#8220;stickers&#8221; to make them look a tad more attractive, you can still choose to hide them altogether. Type your tags in an ordinary text field, reducing them to the smallest possible text size. (You can continue minimizing their size by pinching at the text field after adding it in.)</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1018 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hiding-instagram-hashtags-story-text-field.jpg" alt="Hiding Instagram hashtags in Stories" width="607" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hiding-instagram-hashtags-story-text-field.jpg 607w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hiding-instagram-hashtags-story-text-field-228x300.jpg 228w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px" /></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve added your hashtags to the story, just choose a sticker or GIF to cover them up. Adjust the size as needed to ensure your tags are covered up completely.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1026" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-on-stories.png" alt="Hiding Instagram hashtags in Stories" width="998" height="592" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-on-stories.png 998w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-on-stories-300x178.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hiding-hashtags-on-stories-768x456.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 998px) 100vw, 998px" /></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Ideal Number of Hashtags (for Most Engagement)?</h2>
<p>There are varying studies on the &#8220;magic number&#8221; of hashtags for best engagement, though most tend to agree between the range of <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-hashtags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">9 to 11</a> hashtags.</p>
<p>Despite the generous limit of 30 hashtags per post, some advise users with the &#8220;<a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-hashtags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">less is more</a>&#8221; rule when it comes to tagging posts. This means that it&#8217;s best to stick to a handful of well-researched, relevant hashtags that effectively get your content seen; rather than stuffing your caption with keywords and general phrases to max out your limit.</p>
<div id="attachment_1021" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1021" class="size-full wp-image-1021" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-best-number-of-hashtags-jordynrichardsmusic.jpg" alt="Optimizing Instagram's hashtag limit - using the best amount for engagement (@jordynrichardsmusic)" width="1000" height="734" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-best-number-of-hashtags-jordynrichardsmusic.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-best-number-of-hashtags-jordynrichardsmusic-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-best-number-of-hashtags-jordynrichardsmusic-768x564.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1021" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of jordynrichardsmusic (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>This will likely come off as &#8220;spammy&#8221; or desperate, damaging your post engagement as a result.</p>
<p>However, since there aren&#8217;t any hard and fast rules, it&#8217;s best to experiment with your hashtag strategy. Some may find that 30 hashtags do well for their reach (provided each are relevant to the posted content) &#8211; while others stick to 10 or less. Track your content performance to find out which works best for you.</p>
<h2>How to Optimize the Instagram Hashtag Limit</h2>
<p>Aside from knowing how many to use, there are other methods of optimizing your Instagram hashtags and gaining the best possible engagement for your content. These include:</p>
<h3>Knowing What Hashtags to Use</h3>
<p>It may sound simple enough, but for those new to the game, finding appropriate, top-performing hashtags for your content can get a bit puzzling.</p>
<p>As a general rule, hashtags should always be relevant to the content they&#8217;re used for. A good first step would be determining the hashtags used in your specific niche. These could be as generic as &#8220;#travel&#8221; or &#8220;#photography&#8221;; though there are plenty other lesser-known tags that use slang or phrases specific to the community.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1032" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-travel-hashtag.jpg" alt="Instagram - #travel hashtag" width="1000" height="569" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-travel-hashtag.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-travel-hashtag-300x171.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-travel-hashtag-768x437.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>An example of this would be &#8220;#ootd&#8221; or &#8220;#Instafashion&#8221; for accounts related to clothing and fashion styles. A few others are &#8220;#gamestagram&#8221;  or &#8220;#gamingrig&#8221; for those dedicated to video games. These are specific to the industry, and may not be as obvious without a little research.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1029" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-ootd-hashtag.png" alt="Instagram - #ootd hashtag" width="1000" height="733" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-ootd-hashtag.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-ootd-hashtag-300x220.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-ootd-hashtag-768x563.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>To find more effective hashtags for your content&#8230;</p>
<h4>Find Out What Your Competitors Are Using</h4>
<p>An easy way of discovering new, high-performing hashtags is to look at what your competitors are using. Those with trending, engaging content in your community likely have a successful hashtag strategy to match.</p>
<div id="attachment_1015" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1015" class="wp-image-1015 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/find-instagram-hashtags-what-your-competitors-are-using.png" alt="Find out what hashtags your competitors are using (@lost_world_treasures)" width="1000" height="718" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/find-instagram-hashtags-what-your-competitors-are-using.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/find-instagram-hashtags-what-your-competitors-are-using-300x215.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/find-instagram-hashtags-what-your-competitors-are-using-768x551.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1015" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of lost_world_treasures (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Look through their captions and make note of the niche-specific hashtags they often use. This a helpful way of discovering tags unique to your field, and where better to research than on already influential profiles?</p>
<p>This can also help you brainstorm alternative tags if you wish to steer clear of the high competition.</p>
<h4>Use the Search Function</h4>
<p>Another simple way of finding new hashtags is to use Instagram&#8217;s search field. When writing your caption, enter a keyword after the &#8220;#&#8221; symbol to generate a list of hashtag suggestions related to that topic.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1020" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-find-hashtags-search-function.png" alt="Finding Instagram hashtags - using the search function" width="1000" height="1270" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-find-hashtags-search-function.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-find-hashtags-search-function-236x300.png 236w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-find-hashtags-search-function-768x975.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-find-hashtags-search-function-806x1024.png 806w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This method is also useful for determining the post competition for each tag. Each suggestion will also display the number of users using the hashtag, helping you decide whether you&#8217;d want to compete for the same audience &#8211; or use a lower-traffic tag for better search odds.</p>
<h4>Use Online Hashtag Tools</h4>
<p>Instagrammers have it lucky these days; a plethora of online apps and tools are now available to manage your content <em>and </em>perform the necessary marketing research.</p>
<p>This includes hashtag tools &#8211; websites or apps that automatically track down the most effective tags to use in your niche. Such tools include Hashtagify, KeywordTool, and HashMe.</p>
<div id="attachment_1016" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1016" class="size-full wp-image-1016" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hashtagify-instagram-hashtag-app.png" alt="Hashtagify keyword tool" width="1000" height="686" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hashtagify-instagram-hashtag-app.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hashtagify-instagram-hashtag-app-300x206.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hashtagify-instagram-hashtag-app-768x527.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1016" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Hashtagify.</p></div>
<p>These conveniently generate a list of active hashtags under a specific topic, and all you have to do is copy and paste it into your captions. Some may even offer analytical tools to help you track hashtag performance. While some provide their services for free, others may require a small monthly fee &#8211; though it may just be a worthwhile investment.</p>
<h3>Use a Mix of Low and High-Competition Hashtags</h3>
<p>It helps to mix things up when using hashtags, applying both high and low-density tags to your post.</p>
<p>Using a hashtag with high-competition (these often use more generic terms such as &#8220;#adventure&#8221; or &#8220;#art&#8221;) can immediately sort your content in its appropriate category. With the right timing, you may just have a large number of users browsing through that tag, with many likely to stumble across your new post before getting lost in the noise.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1033" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimize-instagram-hashtag-limit-use-low-and-high-density-tags.png" alt="Optimize the Instagram hashtag limit - using both high and low density hashtags" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimize-instagram-hashtag-limit-use-low-and-high-density-tags.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimize-instagram-hashtag-limit-use-low-and-high-density-tags-300x180.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimize-instagram-hashtag-limit-use-low-and-high-density-tags-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Lower-density hashtags, on the other hand, make it easier for your content to &#8220;trend&#8221;. These tags have far less users competing for exposure, granting you visibility for longer period of time.</p>
<p>Being likely more niche-specific, lower-density tags can also help in more accurately targeting your desired audience. It may also be valuable in striking up new connections on the platform.</p>
<h3>Track Your Hashtag Performance</h3>
<p>Finally, be sure to track the effectiveness of your hashtags over time.</p>
<p>While online tools, as mentioned earlier, can help with this &#8211; users can also make use of Instagram&#8217;s native features.</p>
<p>To check the performance of your current hashtag strategy, visit your Instagram Insights.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1027 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-insights.png" alt="Instagram Insights" width="500" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-insights.png 500w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-insights-188x300.png 188w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>This should pull up a feed of your most recent posts. Tap on one, and underneath the post, select &#8220;View Insights&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1030" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-post-view-insights.png" alt="View insights on an Instagram post" width="1000" height="233" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-post-view-insights.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-post-view-insights-300x70.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-post-view-insights-768x179.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>A tab with a brief overview of your post insights should pop up. Drag this up to view it full-screen. In the &#8220;Discovery&#8221; section, you should be able to view the number of impressions you&#8217;ve received via your hashtags.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1031 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-track-hashtag-performance.png" alt="Tracking Instagram hashtag performance" width="730" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-track-hashtag-performance.png 730w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-track-hashtag-performance-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></p>
<p>As you continue experimenting with various tags, keep track of this number to look for signs of progress or decline, and adjust your strategy as needed.</p>
<h2>Bad Practices to Avoid</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to be wary of <em>seemingly </em>clever hashtag methods that may actually do more harm than good. While they&#8217;ll offer that burst of short-term success, it&#8217;s best to keep clear of them altogether. Doing so will not only save your profile reputation, but will help you avoid getting potentially shadowbanned.</p>
<h3>Adding More Hashtags as a Comment</h3>
<p>Though the Instagram hashtag limit is 30 per standard post, users came up with the &#8220;hack&#8221; of adding 30 hashtags as a comment, then going back and adding 30 more in the caption.</p>
<p>Hashtags work whether placed in the actual post caption itself, or added through a comment. Maxing out the 30-tag limit in both areas seemed like a clever way around Instagram&#8217;s restrictions.</p>
<div id="attachment_1022" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1022" class="size-full wp-image-1022" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-hack-instalionaire.png" alt="Instagram hashtag limit hack - Instalionaire" width="1000" height="609" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-hack-instalionaire.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-hack-instalionaire-300x183.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-hashtag-limit-hack-instalionaire-768x468.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1022" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Instalionaire.</p></div>
<p>However, the platform has since caught onto this tactic in 2018. Now, when users attempt to add their extra 30 in the caption, the app will refuse to save your changes.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the practice of stuffing posts with dozens of hashtags may provide that short-term engagement boost &#8211; but it can also appear as a spammy or desperate method. It&#8217;s better to optimize the set limit you&#8217;re given, rather than cramming in all the vaguely related keywords that come to mind.</p>
<h3>Using Shadowbanned, Spammy or Irrelevant Tags</h3>
<p>Along with the Instagram hashtag limit, there are also restrictions on the <em>kinds </em>of hashtags you can use.</p>
<p>When adding your hashtags, be sure they directly address you content. Users will often feel put off by irrelevant posts in their hashtag feeds &#8211; and may even flag your post as a result.</p>
<p>This can put you at risk of a shadowban, or signal the algorithm to show less of your content.</p>
<p>You can also get shadowbanned for using &#8220;banned&#8221; or broken tags &#8211; that is, hashtags that have violated community guidelines and are thus blocked from the platform. When searching up these tags, you&#8217;ll find that the app no longer displays any recent posts.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1019" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-banned-hashtag-boho.png" alt="Instagram banned hashtag - #boho" width="478" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-banned-hashtag-boho.png 478w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/instagram-banned-hashtag-boho-179x300.png 179w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px" /></p>
<p>Using any of these banned tags will not only prevent your content from showing up on its feed, but from the rest of the hashtags you&#8217;ve added to the post. It therefore helps to do a bit of research on the app&#8217;s latest banned hashtags; either by manually searching them on Instagram, or looking for <a href="https://socialbuddy.com/banned-instagram-hashtags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">updated lists</a> online.</p>
<p>Additionally, adding empty, generic hashtags like &#8220;#amazing&#8221; and &#8220;#instadaily&#8221; can come off more spammy than strategic. Such tags leave the impression of seeking that quick &#8220;boost&#8221; in reach, rather than connecting exclusively with those in your niche.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1034 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimizing-instagram-hashtag-limit-dont-use-spammy-hashtags.png" alt="Using spammy Instagram hashtags" width="1000" height="376" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimizing-instagram-hashtag-limit-dont-use-spammy-hashtags.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimizing-instagram-hashtag-limit-dont-use-spammy-hashtags-300x113.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/optimizing-instagram-hashtag-limit-dont-use-spammy-hashtags-768x289.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>The same can be said for tags like &#8220;#like4like&#8221; and &#8220;#follow4follow&#8221; &#8211; sure, they encourage short-term interaction, but such engagement is likely artificial rather than genuine interest from your target audience.</p>
<h3>Using the Same Tags Over and Over Again</h3>
<p>Finally, it&#8217;s crucial to change up your hashtag groups from time to time, avoiding blatant repetition.</p>

<p>Those who successfully profited off their account have two things: reach and influence. These factors allow them to explore potential revenue streams.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways on how to monetize Instagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on sponsored posts</li>
<li>Becoming an affiliate</li>
<li>Using shoppable posts</li>
<li>Selling photography, art, and more</li>
</ul>
<p>But first, you need to grow your account.</p>
<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll give you tips to boost your following. Most importantly, we have a comprehensive guide on how to monetize Instagram.</p>
<h2>How To Grow Your Account</h2>
<p>You already have an account, now what?</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to monetize Instagram, you first need to grow your account. Here&#8217;s a basic checklist:</p>
<h3>Complete Your Bio</h3>
<p>Make use of this space to add details regarding your personal brand. Give your audience reasons to follow you.</p>
<p>Tip: Add CTAs in your bio. In doing so, you&#8217;ll increase the chances of your audience tapping the follow button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1039.jpg" alt="Complete Instagram bio sample" width="750" height="729" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1039.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1039-300x292.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>Post High-Quality Content</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not always about how frequent you post. Remember, quality is better than quantity. Make sure that your content provides value to your audience.</p>
<p>Tip: Stick to a theme for a more cohesive look. Another option is to tell a story through your feed.</p>
<h3>Boost Engagement Rate</h3>
<p>Remember, a large number of followers isn&#8217;t everything. You need to have an engaged audience.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve mentioned earlier, successful influencers have reach and influence. Brands and businesses are more likely to collaborate with you if you have an engaged following.</p>
<p>A 2-3% engagement rate is considered average. Aim for a higher rate. With that said, although top influencers make thousands per Instagram post, those with a small but engaged following can learn how to monetize Instagram as well.</p>

<p>But how do you boost engagement? Here are a few quick tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use branded hashtags. This makes it easier for your audience to find your content. Additionally, it also helps boost brand awareness.</li>
<li>Host giveaways. When hosting giveaways, you can ask participants to tag a friend, like the post, or follow your account.</li>
<li>Interact with your followers. This is crucial in establishing a connection. For instance, if they have a question, try your best to respond. Additionally, you should also like or leave comments on their posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you already have a curated feed and you&#8217;ve built an engaged Instagram following.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to learn how to monetize Instagram!</p>

<p>If you want to learn how to monetize Instagram as an influencer, you need to step up your game.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of time and effort. Here&#8217;s a glimpse of what influencers do behind their beautifully curated feed:</p>

</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m ready for the challenge! So how to monetize Instagram as an influencer?</p>
<h3>Shoutouts</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, some accounts &#8211; even brands, pay you if you mention them in your account.</p>
<p>For instance, someone sends you an Instagram DM asking for a shoutout. Another option is to reach out to an account or brand yourself.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1044.jpg" alt="how to monetize instagram - influencer shoutout" width="750" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1044.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1044-169x300.jpg 169w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1044-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>How much should you charge per shoutout?</p>
<p>It usually depends on the niche. The most common rate is around $100 per shoutout, especially if you have real and engaged followers of more than 50k.</p>
<h3>Sponsored Posts</h3>
<p>A sponsored post looks like your regular content. However, you are showcasing a brand&#8217;s product or service. Usually, these posts include a branded hashtag.</p>
<p>Of course, you&#8217;ll receive a fee for every sponsored content. According to a <a href="https://www.shopify.com.ph/blog/make-money-on-instagram" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">survey of 5,000 influencers</a>, 42% charged between $200 and $400 per post.</p>
<p>Why is this a great strategy on how to monetize Instagram?</p>
<p>Today, audiences are more likely to trust an unbiased third party over a traditional advertisement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-sponsored-post.jpg" alt="how to monetize instagram - sponsored post" width="1172" height="752" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-sponsored-post.jpg 1172w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-sponsored-post-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-sponsored-post-768x493.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-sponsored-post-1024x657.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /></p>
<p>For this reason, businesses are allocating a bigger budget for Instagram marketing. They need influencers to widen their reach.</p>
<p>How to get started?</p>
<h4>Post High Quality and Stylish Content</h4>
<p>Establishing a good Instagram presence is a must. This is pretty obvious; however, it bears repeating.</p>
<p>Think of your Instagram account as your portfolio. Brands will look at your feed to determine whether you&#8217;re the right fit. Here are a few things brands take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does your content look like?</li>
<li>Do you post original content?</li>
<li>Is your style and personality in line with the brand&#8217;s identity?</li>
<li>What is your follower number and engagement rate?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reach Out To Brands</h4>
<p>Brands usually tap established influencers. However, don&#8217;t be discouraged! You can also look for brands to work with.</p>
<p>For one, you can contact them directly and try coming up with a good deal. Another option is to check out influencer marketplaces. For instance, you can list yourself on <a href="https://influence.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Influence.co</a> or <a href="https://www.tribegroup.co/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">TRIBE</a>.</p>
<p>These platforms help you find the right brand to collaborate with.</p>
<h2>How To Monetize Instagram Tip #2: Sell Affiliate Products</h2>
<p>Becoming an affiliate means you&#8217;re more focused on making sales for your partner business. You&#8217;re not only boosting brand awareness. Your aim is increasing sales!</p>

<p>Why should you care about sales?</p>
<p>In affiliate marketing, you will earn a commission for:</p>
<ul>

<li>Every sale made using your unique promo code</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does this work?</h3>
<p>When you become an affiliate, you&#8217;ll be given a unique, trackable link. The affiliate program will then use it to track how many users clicked your link and purchased from the site. This is how to monetize Instagram.</p>
<p>Remember, you can&#8217;t post links outside your bio or Stories. Therefore, if you&#8217;re using affiliate links, you can only focus on one product at a time.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-861" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-sample.jpg" alt="how to monetize instagram - online course sample" width="1167" height="750" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-sample.jpg 1167w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-sample-300x193.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-sample-768x494.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-sample-1024x658.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1167px) 100vw, 1167px" /></p>

When you look at her account, you&#8217;ll find food recipes. However, she also created courses on food photography.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course.jpg" alt="how to monetize instagram - online course" width="1703" height="918" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course.jpg 1703w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-300x162.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-768x414.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/how-to-monetize-instagram-online-course-1024x552.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1703px) 100vw, 1703px" /></p>
<p>Why? Because her audience kept asking how she took beautiful photos. They asked, she delivered!</p>
<p>How to monetize Instagram via online courses?</p>
<ul>
<li>Host a contest or challenge. This creates hype around your online course. Plus, winners can also provide reviews which help boost awareness.</li>
<li>Pre-sell your course. This entails selling your online course at a discounted price. It&#8217;s a great strategy. For one, you&#8217;ll start earning before your course is created. Secondly, you&#8217;ll gauge whether your audience is willing to pay for your course.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Monetize Instagram Tip #5: Create Your Own Brand</h2>
<p>This strategy is quite different from growing your existing brand. This strategy involves launching a brand new business on Instagram.</p>
<p>Instagram is an awesome platform to showcase your products. When done right, it&#8217;ll drive traffic to your site.</p>
<p>Take for example the beauty brand, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/glossier/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Glossier</a>. It was launched in 2014 by Emily Weiss.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-863" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1065.jpg" alt="how to monetize instagram - create your own brand" width="750" height="932" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1065.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_1065-241x300.jpg 241w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" />When she gained a sizeable following, she created a line of beauty and skincare products. Then she launched Glossier on Instagram.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was a huge success. They attracted 13,000 followers even before their products were launched on their online site.</p>
<h3>What they did right:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prioritized Instagram as the core of their marketing strategy. Their customers are on Instagram. Therefore, use the platform to create your online persona and connect with your audience.</li>
<li>Posted over 125 Instagram photos before launching. In doing so, they were able to establish brand identity and generate buzz.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the addition of shopping tags, it&#8217;s so much easier for their audience to shop their feed.</p>

<p>Today, more and more Instagram influencers are following Glossier&#8217;s footsteps. Some of them are selling their own merchandise to monetize Instagram.</p>
<p>Another example is from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kravebeauty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Krave Beauty</a>. Liah Yoo, the founder and CEO of this beauty company, found the need for sustainable and reliable skincare products.</p>

<p>Instagram is an awesome platform for visual content. Therefore, Instagram sponsored ads are highly effective in attracting a new audience. In fact, according to a recent study, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/insights/how-instagram-boosts-brands-and-drives-sales" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">83% of users say they discover products and services on Instagram</a>.

<p>However, you can&#8217;t simply take your existing campaign and put them on the platform. It requires a lot of thought.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve come up with a quick guide for creating Instagram ads and how much it costs. Plus we&#8217;ve listed a few key Instagram ads strategies that convert!</p>
<h2>But First, Does Instagram Ads Really Work?</h2>
<p>Advertising on Instagram means paying to post sponsored content. This allows your business to reach a wider and more targeted market.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons why brands pay for Instagram sponsored ads include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grow brand awareness</li>
<li>Increase website traffic</li>
<li>Generate new leads</li>
<li>Convert following to sales</li>
</ul>
<p>The best part of Instagram ads is that they work. According to a study, 80% of users say Instagram helps them decide whether to buy a product or not. Additionally, <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">75% of users take action after seeing an ad</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-276" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0669.jpg" alt="Instagram ads in Stories" width="750" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0669.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0669-169x300.jpg 169w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0669-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Because of this high success rate, Instagram now has <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">more than 2 million monthly advertisers</a>. Users see Instagram sponsored ads every three or four posts. Aside from the feed, brands can also advertise through Stories.</p>
<h2>Need More Reasons To Pay For Instagram Sponsored Ads?</h2>
<h3>Wide Demographics</h3>
<p>In recent years, Instagram&#8217;s monthly active users continue to rise. For this reason, there&#8217;s a high chance that your target audience is on the platform too!</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/325587/instagram-global-age-group/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Statista 2019</a>, 71% of the active Instagram users are younger than 35 years old. The most common age range is between 25 and 34. This is followed by millennials aged between 18 and 24.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the age bracket of your target audience? If your audience consists of young adults, it&#8217;s worth investing in Instagram ads.</p>
<h3>Access To Facebook&#8217;s Advanced Targeting Tools</h3>
<p>Instagram uses Facebook Advertising System. This gives you detailed control to target a specific market. With this platform, you can target an audience based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Interest and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus you can target a custom audience. This allows you to show Instagram ads to your direct list of leads.</p>
<h3>Instagram Sponsored Ads Doesn&#8217;t Look Like Ads</h3>
<p>Instagram advertisements blend seamlessly into the user&#8217;s feed. They are less obstructive. Therefore, these ads don&#8217;t disrupt the user experience on the platform. More importantly, users are more likely to engage because they don&#8217;t look like an ad.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-275" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0690.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1203" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0690.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0690-187x300.jpg 187w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0690-638x1024.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3>Instagram&#8217;s Shoppable Posts</h3>
<p>As of 2019, Instagram is focusing on its shopping features. Their aim is for their users to shop without leaving the app. This takes online shopping to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Businesses can leverage Instagram ads to boost their shoppable posts. For instance, Instagram sponsored ads can have a &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; option at the bottom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the shoppable post is an ad, more users will see it.</li>
<li>The user then has the option to shop the post</li>
<li>A &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; link allows users to see more options.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-277" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0691.jpg" alt="Shoppable instagram ads" width="750" height="1204" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0691.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0691-187x300.jpg 187w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0691-638x1024.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-254" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.026.png" alt="Instagram ads cost" width="1200" height="1024" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.026.png 1200w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.026-300x256.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.026-768x655.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.026-1024x874.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>One of the key factors to look into when estimating Instagram ads cost is the time of the year. Based on the graph, cost-per-click increases as the year progresses. This means when you advertise during the last quarter, Instagram ads cost will be at an all-time high.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-256" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.028.png" alt="Instagram ads cost" width="1200" height="1024" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.028.png 1200w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.028-300x256.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.028-768x655.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fb_ads_cost-charts-2017-review.028-1024x874.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>What other factors affect Instagram ads cost?</h3>
<p><strong>Cost per Click:</strong> This means your advertising expense will depend on how many users clicked your ad. You are paying for the click and not the sales.</p>
<p><strong>Cost per Impression:</strong> This option means paying for every thousand impressions that your Instagram sponsored ads received.</p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell:</strong> depending on factors like demographics or location, the cost can rise or fall dramatically.</p>

<h3>Focus On Your Customer&#8217;s Interest</h3>
<p>To provide value, you need to know what your audience wants. Create Instagram ads that connect with your market.</p>
<p>Tip: Create a profile of your target market. In doing so, you can craft marketing strategies that use the right messages as well as address their needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>What does your ideal customer need and want?</li>
<li>Can your product or service address this need?</li>
<li>How can your brand help?</li>
</ul>
<p>By answering these questions, you&#8217;ll have key marketing messages for your ads.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kravebeauty/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@kravebeauty</a> as an example. Their brand focuses on its customers&#8217; need for minimal skincare. Therefore, they offer simple, uncomplicated skincare products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kravebeauty.jpg" alt="Instagram ads" width="1076" height="752" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kravebeauty.jpg 1076w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kravebeauty-300x210.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kravebeauty-768x537.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kravebeauty-1024x716.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1076px) 100vw, 1076px" /></p>
<p>In this particular post, they listed how their products can be used to address different skin issues. All the while emphasizing the need to keep things simple.</p>
<h3>Tease Your Audience</h3>
<p>Post product teasers that tug on your audience&#8217; curiosity. More importantly, teaser ads should gently urge the market to buy.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be too pushy lest you scare away your potential customers. Use teaser ads to talk about your product or service. Increase their excitement without hard selling.</p>
<p>Here is an Instagram Stories ad from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/indybrandclothing/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@indybrandclothing</a>. The brand showed off a photo of some of their products that are available on site.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-265" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0667.jpg" alt="Instagram ads in Stories" width="750" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0667.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0667-169x300.jpg 169w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0667-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, they used the Swipe Up feature making shopping much easier.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-266 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0668.jpg" alt="Instagram ads in Stories" width="750" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0668.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0668-169x300.jpg 169w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0668-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Look at this Instagram sponsored ad from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/forloveandlemons/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@forloveandlemons</a>. They introduced their Pre-Fall 2019 collection. They used the carousel feature to tease the audience &#8211; giving a glimpse of what they can expect.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-267 alignnone" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/forloveandlemons-instagram-ads-carousel.jpg" alt="forloveandlemons instagram ads carousel" width="2250" height="1180" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/forloveandlemons-instagram-ads-carousel.jpg 2250w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/forloveandlemons-instagram-ads-carousel-300x157.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/forloveandlemons-instagram-ads-carousel-768x403.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/forloveandlemons-instagram-ads-carousel-1024x537.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /></p>
<p>Another example is from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/starbucks/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@starbucks</a>. They announced the return of their S&#8217;mores drink with an <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-contest/" data-wpel-link="internal">Instagram contest</a>!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-268" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starbucks-Instagram-ads.jpg" alt="starbucks Instagram ads" width="1165" height="748" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starbucks-Instagram-ads.jpg 1165w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starbucks-Instagram-ads-300x193.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starbucks-Instagram-ads-768x493.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starbucks-Instagram-ads-1024x657.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1165px) 100vw, 1165px" /></p>
<h4>What they did right:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Used carousel to feature more product photos</li>
<li>Didn&#8217;t force people to make a purchase</li>
<li>Hyped the product through a contest</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make Buying Your Product As Easy As Possible</h3>
<p>It is only recently that Instagram developed its shopping platform. Today, users can simply tap on shoppable posts to buy. In fact, Instagram&#8217;s goal is for users to have a complete shopping experience without leaving the app.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why brands can leverage Instagram ads to boost sales. However, creating a conversion campaign is quite different from awareness or engagement-driven advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make the buying process quick and easy.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>For one, you can add a call-to-action (CTA) in your ad copy. Be clear with your messaging. Explain what the audience needs to do to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Take this example from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sephora/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@sephora</a>. First, they added a &#8220;Shop Now&#8221; link where users are redirected to their online store. Secondly, they kept their ad copy short and concise. Lastly, they added a simple CTA, &#8220;Shop @Sephora&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-269" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0678.jpg" alt="Instagram ads by Sephora" width="750" height="1111" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0678.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0678-203x300.jpg 203w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0678-691x1024.jpg 691w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Utilize CTAs in your Instagram advertisements. Here are a few you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop Now</li>
<li>Book Now</li>
<li>Sign Up Now</li>
<li>Learn More</li>
<li>Contact Us</li>
</ul>
<h3>Partner with Influencers</h3>
<p>If your campaign objective is to reach a wider audience, consider collaborating with influencers. In doing so, you&#8217;ll be tapping their audience.</p>
<p>Instagram users are more likely to buy products or avail services endorsed by influential people. Why? Because influencers are trusted by their followers.</p>
<p>First of all, identify a few influencers within your niche. Secondly, don&#8217;t just look at their following. Take into account their engagement rate. Most importantly, make sure that their audience profile is your target market.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uruoiskincare/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@uruoiskincare</a>, a Japanese skincare brand, used <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michellechoii/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@michellechoii</a> to promote their products.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-270" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/michelle-choii-instagram-ads-with-influencer.jpg" alt="michelle choii instagram ads with influencer" width="1018" height="751" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/michelle-choii-instagram-ads-with-influencer.jpg 1018w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/michelle-choii-instagram-ads-with-influencer-300x221.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/michelle-choii-instagram-ads-with-influencer-768x567.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<p>Michelle Choii is a lifestyle and skincare influencer. Therefore, she&#8217;s a great choice for advertising their products.</p>
<h3>Create An Interactive Branded Hashtag</h3>
<p>If your campaign objective is to boost engagement, then creating a branded hashtag is one way to achieve it.</p>
<p>Your audience can use it to tag posts. In doing so, you can easily search for posts related to your ad campaign. More importantly, when customers use your branded hashtag, it is essentially free advertising.</p>
<p>Look at this post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/redbull/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@redbull</a>. Their interactive branded hashtag #wingsatwork racked over 1K posts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-271" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0682.jpg" alt="redbull wingsatwork instagram sponsored ads" width="750" height="836" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0682.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_0682-269x300.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>What they did right:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created a branded hashtag</li>
<li>Encouraged people to use the hashtag</li>
<li>Promised their audience a chance to be featured on a Red Bull office takeover</li>
</ul>
<p>And who could forget the viral hashtag #ShareACoke by Coca-Cola which earned 662K posts? Now that is a successful Instagram ad campaign!</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>
<h2>Time To Create Your Own Instagram Ads</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t be intimidated with Instagram. It&#8217;s the best platform for reaching a wider audience with over a billion monthly active users.</p>
<p>With that said, start investing in Instagram ads. It&#8217;ll surely make a difference to your brand&#8217;s growth and sales.</p>
<p>Remember, it all starts with your business goals. From there, set your campaign objects. Lastly, take the marketing strategies we&#8217;ve listed to create winning Instagram sponsored ads.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-famous/" data-wpel-link="internal">Instagram influencers</a> still garner a lot of traction for many big brands, more and more are turning to micro-influencers for brand deals. There are a lot of subcategories of influencer these days, and micro-influencers are still relatively undiscovered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While you may be dreaming of making it big, perhaps it’s best to refocus on becoming a micro-influencer. And if you’re a brand, forget about a Kardashian deal, and turn to the local community you want to reach out to. Why is micro-influencer marketing so successful? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People trust micro-influencers in a way they don’t trust other celebrities, and they’re much more likely to take the recommendation of someone they already know and follow over someone they don’t. Let’s take a deep dive into why micro-influencer marketing is so successful, and how you can get started…</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s A Micro-Influencer?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, a micro-influencer is any person on Instagram who has between 1000 and 1 million followers on Instagram &#8211; although it’s pretty safe to say once someone reaches a million followers they’ve surpassed the micro levels. What I&#8217;ll refer to as a &#8220;true&#8221; micro-influencer is someone with between 1,000 and 10,000 followers. Their communities can be pretty niche, but they generally have a very engaged audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-influencers are rising because their engagement rates tend to be much higher than the most-followed people. In fact, the average micro-influencer engagement rate is around 85% higher than someone with more than a million followers. That&#8217;s a significant difference! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micro-influencers are considered experts in their fields, and their communities are generally much more engaged and active than others. Some micro-influencers you might be aware of, are local fashion and <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/top-beauty-bloggers/" data-wpel-link="internal">beauty bloggers</a>, food bloggers, or travel bloggers. (The travel community, in particular, generates a lot of micro-influencers focused on a particular travel niche.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As millennials and Gen Z prove their dislike for overly corporate marketing tactics time and time again, it makes sense that brands would turn to micro-influencers. Trust is what&#8217;s lacking in so much of it. Young people, especially young Instagram users, want to feel seen and heard. They want advertising to be personal to them rather than just a number. To young people, a micro-influencer&#8217;s personal touch is marketing gold.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Micro-influencers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&#8217;re a brand looking to advertise, you might think going straight to The Rock with your pitch will skyrocket your business to the next level. But that&#8217;s not always true. If you&#8217;re new, The Rock probably hasn&#8217;t heard of you. You might not have the budget to work with a big celebrity. Or you might be a business specific to a certain locale looking to advertise within it. </span></p>
<p>If any of these sound like you, it might be time to consider reaching out to a micro-influencer. Before you say &#8220;bigger is better&#8221;, read on. Using a micro-influencer has <span style="font-weight: 400;">some great benefits you may not have thought of. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few of them below: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Engagement </span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve already touched on this a bit, but if you’re a brand looking for an influencer to make a deal with, their engagement rate should be a top priority. After all, you don’t want a deal that isn’t going to lead anywhere. Because micro-influencers have smaller communities, it’s much easier for them to know exactly how to advertise to their audience. Micro-influencers are connected to their community in a way bigger names just aren&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t just about the rate though &#8211; it’s also about their own engagement with a community. Let’s say, Ariana Grande, is drowning in millions of notifications a day, but a micro-influencer can answer personal questions about a brand and respond to audience concerns faster. They have the ‘real’ factor: their audience sees them as someone they can know and trust, which, speaking from experience, is a way better way to attract new buyers than a click-and-post celeb ad campaign. </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Better rates</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A micro-influencer is a lot more affordable for starting brands to work with. They won’t demand millions from you, especially if they’re on the lower side of Instagram followers. Micro-influencers’ lower rates mean they’re much more accessible for starting brands, and their high engagement is a boost both to you and to them. </span></p>
<p>Brands often find that micro-influencers are also a lot more willing to negotiate. Since you&#8217;ll likely be working directly with the influencer themselves rather than a representative, there is more wiggle room when it comes to asking for things. Increased communication allows both parties to express themselves clearly.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it’s much more affordable, consider working with more than one micro-influencer to cast a wider net. It’ll most likely have serious benefits and get you into a super niche market! </span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Good Conversion Rates</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a reason influencer marketing is so effective. Did you know that 49% of Instagram users trust influencer recommendations? And they’re even more likely to trust someone that they know and trust from years of following. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram users feel like they grow along with the influencers they follow. I can speak from personal experience here: I’ve bought clothes because an influencer who had a similar size, shape, and coloring to me looked amazing in them. If I had seen that advertisement on a sidebar, it wouldn&#8217;t have even caught my eye.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-363 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/adult-banking-blur-1288483-1-1024x684.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/adult-banking-blur-1288483-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/adult-banking-blur-1288483-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/adult-banking-blur-1288483-1-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Particularly if an Instagram user has trusted a different recommendation from an influencer, they&#8217;re far more likely to repeat a purchase. Many people have discovered some of their favorite products through Instagram brand deals! And having a small, tight-knit community only lends legitimacy to an influencer recommendation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An influencer recommendation is way more personal than a magazine ad or modeling campaign, and a micro-influencer ad is double the effectiveness. If you’re serious about earning cash, why not hire a micro-influencer to increase your reach?</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reaching a Niche </span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers nowadays are suspicious with their money. If you’re a new brand barging into a niche market, it can be very hard to earn consumer trust. Especially with young people tiring of constant advertisements directed at them without any specificity. They crave personalization and communications. The good news is that micro-influencers already have a solid, specific audience that’s just waiting for you. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When considering a micro-influencer, consider the type of person you want to advertise to. Are you looking to target teenage girls? Working moms? Boys 18-25 who are into sports? No matter the specificity &#8211; Chances are, there’s a micro-influencer for that. There are niche Instagram communities all over the place. All it takes is a few hashtag searches for your specific target audience, and you’re on your way to the micro-influencer campaign of your brand’s dreams.</span></p>
<h2> Micro-influencers Are On The Rise</h2>
<p>Brands love micro-influencers for a lot of reasons. Their high engagement rates and ultra-specific niches are marketing gold. They&#8217;re more affordable than a Kardashian. And they often do the most amount of conversion for the brands they work with. If you&#8217;re a brand looking to boost sales, it&#8217;s definitely worth considering a micro-influencer (or more!) for a campaign.</p>
<p>If you want to become a micro-influencer, take the time to foster a very close community. Make a special effort to keep up with your followers and build that kind of close-knit following brands are looking for. Make an effort to keep a high engagement rate and stand out &#8211; and you will.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of 2019, Instagram has over 1 billion active users. How do you stand out? Hosting an Instagram contest is an awesome way for you to gain attention.</p>
<p>Instagram contests will help you achieve short-term goals. However, hosting one isn&#8217;t as easy as winning one. Before you dive into your first giveaway, we&#8217;ll discuss a few important things.</p>
<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll take a closer look at how an Instagram contest can benefit your brand. Additionally, we&#8217;ll discuss the rules and basic tips for hosting a giveaway. Lastly, we&#8217;ve listed a few winning ideas you should try!</p>
<h2>Why You Should Run An Instagram Contest</h2>
<h3>Grow Your Account</h3>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of Instagram contests is they help you grow your account. This is especially beneficial for small, start-up brands.</p>
<p>For instance, you ran a contest where participants are asked to share an Instagram post. In doing so, you&#8217;ll reach a wider audience. Users who haven&#8217;t heard about your business will have a chance to check you out.</p>
<p>Based on the study conducted by Tailwind, accounts that host giveaways grow <a href="https://blog.tailwindapp.com/instagram-contest-ideas-that-will-grow-your-followers-70-faster/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">70x faster than those who don&#8217;t</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-196 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-accounts-that-hold-contests-grow-70-percent-faster-stat.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-accounts-that-hold-contests-grow-70-percent-faster-stat.jpg 940w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-accounts-that-hold-contests-grow-70-percent-faster-stat-300x251.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Instagram-accounts-that-hold-contests-grow-70-percent-faster-stat-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, we all like free stuff.</p>
<p>Therefore, when users can get freebies by simply tapping the follow button, they&#8217;re more likely to do so. Give your audience a good reason to hit that button.</p>
<p>With that said, aside from giving incentives, you must also strive to provide valuable content.</p>
<h3>Boost Engagement</h3>
<p>An Instagram contest gets higher engagement than a regular post. In fact, according to Tailwind, Instagram giveaways get 3.5x as many likes and 64x more comments compared to normal content.</p>
<p>Contests usually require participants to like, comment, or share a post. The higher the engagement, the more likely a post will appear on a user&#8217;s feed as well as on Instagram explore. This will then attract new and relevant fans.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-198 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puravidabracelets-instagram-contest.jpg" alt="puravidabracelets instagram contest" width="1500" height="1112" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puravidabracelets-instagram-contest.jpg 1500w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puravidabracelets-instagram-contest-300x222.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puravidabracelets-instagram-contest-768x569.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/puravidabracelets-instagram-contest-1024x759.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>But don&#8217;t stop there!</p>
<p>Take advantage of the traction gained by your Instagram contest to build a relationship with your audience. Make sure that this engagement will last.</p>
<p>For one, keep your feed responsive by answering queries. More importantly, keep the conversation going.</p>
<h3>Increase In Sales</h3>
<p>Hosting a contest is basically giving away free samples of your product. The winner will be able to try it out. They can:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Give a product review which helps boost product awareness.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">If they enjoyed your product, they&#8217;ll buy more from your brand.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Lastly, they are more likely to recommend your brand to their followers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a look at this unique Instagram contest by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/indybrandclothing/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@indybrandclothing</a>. They launched a giveaway in time for Stranger Things Season 3 premiere.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-197 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/indybrandclothing-instagram-contest.jpg" alt="indybrandclothing instagram contest" width="1018" height="749" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/indybrandclothing-instagram-contest.jpg 1018w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/indybrandclothing-instagram-contest-300x221.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/indybrandclothing-instagram-contest-768x565.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1018px) 100vw, 1018px" /></p>
<h4>What they did right:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Boost engagement by encouraging participants to like and tag friends</li>
<li>Improve brand awareness by asking them to post in Stories</li>
</ul>
<p>This giveaway will also give winners a chance to try their clothes. If they liked the quality, they&#8217;ll purchase more.</p>
<p>More importantly, an Instagram contest is also useful in capturing leads. Instead of reaching out to random accounts, you can look at the list of participants. These accounts are likely to be interested in your brand.</p>
<h3>Collect User-Generated Content</h3>
<p>Instagram contests are also perfect for collecting user-generated content you can use later on. For instance, you can run a photo contest. And as part of the Instagram contest rules, the winner will be featured in your account.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-winner-for-UGC.jpg" alt="instagram contest winner for UGC" width="1172" height="750" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-winner-for-UGC.jpg 1172w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-winner-for-UGC-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-winner-for-UGC-768x491.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-winner-for-UGC-1024x655.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1172px) 100vw, 1172px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a win-win situation. You can re-purpose the entries and the winners will feel valued. As a result, it helps build loyalty, encouraging them to support your brand more.</p>
<p>Ready to run your own Instagram contest? But first, you must know the rules!</p>
<h2>How To Play By Instagram Contest Rules</h2>
<p>While Instagram contests are a highly effective marketing strategy, it&#8217;s not as easy as they appear. You can&#8217;t simply host a last-minute giveaway. There are important <a href="https://help.instagram.com/179379842258600" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram contest rules</a> you need to follow.</p>
<h3>Instagram Contest Rules #1: Understand The Laws In Your Area</h3>
<p>Laws and regulations in different regions are already complex. It&#8217;s twice as hard when applied to an online platform. This becomes even more complicated when you host an international Instagram contest.</p>
<p>With that said, familiarize the laws in your area. More importantly, hire a lawyer. In doing so, they can help review your Instagram contest mechanics and make sure you&#8217;re not breaking any law.</p>
<h3>Instagram Contest Rules #2: Clearly State That Your Instagram Contest Is Not Associated With Instagram</h3>
<p>Explicitly state that the contest or giveaway is in no way associated or sponsored by Instagram. This is one of the easiest Instagram contest rules to follow. Simply add a statement similar to this one:</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8220;This contest is not sponsored by Instagram&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-rules-2.jpg" alt="instagram contest rules 2" width="815" height="673" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-rules-2.jpg 815w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-rules-2-300x248.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/instagram-contest-rules-2-768x634.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" /></p>
<h3>Instagram Contest Rules #3: Do Not Encourage Inaccurate Tagging</h3>
<p>Instagram contests usually encourage participants to tag family and friends. In doing so, brands boost visibility and engagement.</p>
<p>But where do you draw the line to avoid breaking Instagram contest rules?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask users to tag themselves or a friend in the comments section.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t encourage them to tag other users on a photo</li>
<li>Emphasize that participants cannot tag your brand in a post where your products or services are not included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another option is to ask participants to use your branded hashtags. In doing so, you can easily track entries. More importantly, branded hashtags increase brand awareness. It puts your products in front of a larger audience.</p>
<h3>Instagram Contest Rules #4: Clearly State Contest Mechanics</h3>
<p>Make your contest mechanics simple and clear. Instagram contest mechanics are usually found in the caption.</p>
<p>However, some brands also put them on their website or blog. If this is the case, make sure to include the link in your bio throughout the contest duration.</p>
<h4>What to include in a contest or giveaway guideline?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add eligibility requirements. This includes the specific location of the participants allowed. If it&#8217;s an international giveaway, then say that the contest is open internationally.</li>
<li>List Instagram contest rules on how to enter</li>
<li>Include the deadline for entries</li>
<li>Disclose info about how the winner will be announced</li>

<h2>Quick Tips For Hosting An Instagram Contest</h2>
<h3>Determine Your Goals</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s best to have a plan before you start setting up a contest or giveaway. First, you need to have a goal.</p>
<p>What do you want to achieve from this marketing strategy?</p>
<p>Some of the most common objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boosting brand awareness</li>
<li>Drum up audience excitement for a product launch</li>
<li>Grow your Instagram account</li>
<li>Attract more engagement in your post</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at this example from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/supergoop/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@supergoop</a>, a beauty brand that focuses on UV protection. In this Instagram giveaway, they partnered with another known beauty brand, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/summerfridays/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@summerfridays</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/supergoop-instagram-contest.jpg" alt="supergoop instagram contest" width="1500" height="1108" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/supergoop-instagram-contest.jpg 1500w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/supergoop-instagram-contest-300x222.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/supergoop-instagram-contest-768x567.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/supergoop-instagram-contest-1024x756.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>They also encouraged participants to like the post and tag someone.</p>
<p>So what do you think are their goals?</p>
<ul>
<li>Boost product awareness</li>
<li>Increase engagement through likes and comments</li>
<li>Grow their account through the &#8220;follow&#8221; guideline</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, your goals will help determine your Instagram contest rules &#8211; which brings us to our next point.</p>
<h3>List A Detailed Contest Guideline</h3>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve determined your goals, it&#8217;s time to decide the mode of entry. Create clear guidelines on how your audience can participate.</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be written in your promotional material.</li>
<li>Some guidelines are listed in the caption section.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, make sure that your contest mechanics align with your goals. Most importantly, make it easy to enter!</p>
<p>As a tip, don&#8217;t go beyond 3 steps.</p>
<p>Take a look at this Instagram contest by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/liahyoo/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@liahyoo</a>. She listed 3 Instagram contest rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow her account and her partner brand</li>
<li>Like the post</li>
<li>Tag a friend + product suggestion</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/liahyoo-instagrm-contest-ideas.jpg" alt="liahyoo instagram contest ideas" width="1500" height="1116" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/liahyoo-instagrm-contest-ideas.jpg 1500w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/liahyoo-instagrm-contest-ideas-300x223.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/liahyoo-instagrm-contest-ideas-768x571.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/liahyoo-instagrm-contest-ideas-1024x762.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>These rules are very easy to follow which encourages her audience to participate. Plus, she opened up a conversation regarding the product.</p>
<h3>Choose A Price</h3>
<p>Avoid giving away prizes that are not brand-related. This may gain more entries; however, it&#8217;ll also attract freeloaders who aren&#8217;t interested in your products or services. Therefore, be strategic when choosing a prize.</p>
<p>Look at this post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/flackerscrackers/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@flackerscrackers</a>. They are a food and beverage company that focuses on simple ingredients and superseed power.</p>
<p>In this Instagram contest, they are giving away a goodie box of their organic flax seed plus other products from their partner brands.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flackerscrackers-instagram-contest.jpg" alt="flackerscrackers instagram contest" width="1168" height="749" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flackerscrackers-instagram-contest.jpg 1168w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flackerscrackers-instagram-contest-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flackerscrackers-instagram-contest-768x492.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/flackerscrackers-instagram-contest-1024x657.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px" /></p>
<p>In doing so, they give the winners a chance to try their products. If they liked them, they&#8217;ll be more willing to buy more.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Consider giving away product samples. This is enough to entice the audience to participate.</p>
<p>You should also take into account your mode of entry. Say, for example, participants are asked to upload a photo, then you need a more convincing prize.</p>
<h3>Promote Your Contest</h3>
<p>Creating a guideline and setting the prize isn&#8217;t enough. Let your audience know that a giveaway is ongoing!<br />
Make sure that your Instagram contest gets attention to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>So how do you spread the word? Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote it to your Instagram stories</li>
<li>Post it on your blog or website</li>
<li>Create an attractive, high-quality content related to your giveaway</li>
<li>Cross-promote it to other social media platforms</li>
<li>Use popular hashtags like #instagramcontest, #contestarlert, #ad</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you need more entries, consider posting a reminder. Look at how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beeswrap/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@beeswrap</a> handled their giveaway promotion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beeswrap-instagram-contest.jpg" alt="beeswrap instagram contest promotion" width="1163" height="750" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beeswrap-instagram-contest.jpg 1163w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beeswrap-instagram-contest-300x193.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beeswrap-instagram-contest-768x495.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/beeswrap-instagram-contest-1024x660.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1163px) 100vw, 1163px" /></p>
<p>Another option is to partner with influencers in your industry. In doing so, you&#8217;ll not only promote your giveaway but also tap into their audience.</p>
<h2>Winning Instagram Contest Ideas</h2>
<h3>Like And Tag To Win</h3>
<p>This is one of the most popular Instagram contest ideas.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re simply asking participants to like the photo and tag a friend. Of course, you can add other mechanics. For example, you can ask your audience to leave a comment as to why they want to win.</p>
<p>Take this example from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/glowrecipe/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@glowrecipe</a>. Aside from asking participants to like the post, they also encouraged discussion in the comment section.</p>

<p>Most brands and influencers use likes and tags as modes of entry. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s very easy to participate</li>
<li>Improves organic reach</li>
<li>Boosts brand visibility</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no surprise that Instagram’s become a lucrative, money-making online space for businesses and influencers alike. Statistics show that there are currently <strong><em>over one billion monthly active users </em></strong>as of 2019, <strong><a href="https://business.instagram.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">80%</a></strong> of which are currently following a brand account.</p>
<p>To top that off, <strong><a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started?ref=igb_carousel" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">60%</a></strong> of Instagrammers discover new products or services on the platform, and <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/15-09-15-how_does_your_brand_stack_up_on_facebook_twitter_and_instagram/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">brand engagement</a> is <strong>10 times higher </strong>than Facebook, <strong>54 times higher </strong>than Pinterest, and <strong><em>84 times </em>greater </strong>than Twitter (<a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/instagram-stats/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">calculations</a> taken from Brandwatch)– so it’s no wonder people flock to the site to for some cash potential.</p>
<div id="attachment_77" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77" class="size-full wp-image-77" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-postmates.png" alt="How to make money on Instagram" width="1000" height="639" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-postmates.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-postmates-300x192.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-postmates-768x491.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-77" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of postmates (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>With the ease of setting up a profile and the user-friendliness of the platform, pursuing an online business venture on Instagram isn’t that far-fetched a goal. In fact, you can learn how to make money on Instagram <em>today; </em>but first, let’s discuss essentials.</p>
<h2>How To Get Paid On Instagram – What You’ll Need</h2>
<p>Before you start chasing after dollar signs, it’s vital to have these Instagram factors in check.</p>
<h3>A Substantial Following</h3>
<p>Monetizing your Instagram requires loyal customers – generally derived from an already established audience. It’s thus imperative that you’ve gained yourself a decent following of loyal, interested consumers; people who’ve “subscribed” to your profile and brand, and are eagerly willing to see more.</p>
<div id="attachment_131" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131" class="size-full wp-image-131" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-ayylienclothing.png" alt="Get paid on Instagram through your online store - ayylienclothing" width="1000" height="764" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-ayylienclothing.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-ayylienclothing-300x229.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-ayylienclothing-768x587.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-131" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of ayylienclothing (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Think of the most successful businesses currently thriving on the platform; chances are, these accounts hold a minimum of four digits in their follower count. Getting paid on Instagram involves selling <em>yourself </em>or a <em>product</em> – and without a following, who will you be selling to?</p>
<h3>An Engaged Audience</h3>
<p>As much as numbers make a difference, follower <em>engagement </em>rules above the rest. Having an impressive number displayed on your follower count provides other users with a social proof, yes. But it also undoubtedly creates a temporary feeling of flattery and success.</p>
<p>However, even if you flaunt an Instagram following in the thousands – little to no engagement from these users make about as much sales impact has having a <strong>few hundred followers.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_75" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" class="size-full wp-image-75" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-michellelewin.jpg" alt="Make money on Instagram with engaged followers" width="1000" height="641" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-michellelewin.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-michellelewin-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-michellelewin-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-75" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of michelle_lewin (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Therefore, learn to engage with your audience, encouraging them to like, comment, and interact with your content. And above all else – don’t settle for fake or bot followers; this type of “empty” audience can clearly show in your non-existent post engagement. At the same time, it can put you at risk of the Instagram <strong>“shadowban”.</strong></p>
<h3>Creativity and Drive</h3>
<p>Now comes the fun (if not most challenging) part of the process – having an outstanding business idea or persona.</p>
<p>Making money on Instagram comes in two main forms: having your own business, or being an influencer. Either path involves having unique, original ideas to help you stand out from the crowd. If you’re an influencer, you’ll need an exceptional personality and aesthetic; if you’re a business, you’ll need a product in high demand with competitive edge above the rest. After all, you’ve got over <strong>25 million </strong>other brands on the platform to compete with.</p>
<div id="attachment_120" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120" class="size-full wp-image-120" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-therealmoonpie.jpg" alt="Get paid on Instagram through creative marketing - therealmoonpie" width="1000" height="640" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-therealmoonpie.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-therealmoonpie-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-therealmoonpie-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-120" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of theoriginalmoonpie (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>To top it off, you’ll need the <strong>drive and persistence </strong>to find success. While the potential of earning top dollar is there, you’re going to have to put in the hard yards to get there. This includes the consistent creation of high-quality content, rigorous marketing, and frequent interaction with other users and followers.</p>
<h3>A Business Profile</h3>

<h2>How To Make Money On Instagram #1 – Brand Sponsorships</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve laid the groundwork for monetizing Instagram, it’s time to explore your options. One of the most common and popular ways of getting paid on Instagram is through brand deals or <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-sponsored-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">sponsorships</a> as a content creator or influencer.</p>
<p>Through sponsored posts, brands will pay you feature their product or service on your profile. In turn, you’ll get paid for your efforts, and they get access to your audience.</p>
<div id="attachment_93" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93" class="size-full wp-image-93" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-aakritiranaofficial.jpg" alt="How to get paid on Instagram - sponsored posts" width="1000" height="639" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-aakritiranaofficial.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-aakritiranaofficial-300x192.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-aakritiranaofficial-768x491.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-93" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of aakritiranaofficial (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>This is where having an <strong>established, engaged following</strong> becomes a necessity. Businesses tend to partner up with users who have <strong>substantial amount of reach and influence</strong>; their primary goal is to raise brand and product awareness, after all.</p>
<p>When doing a brand deal, it also helps to over-deliver in your post. This flaunts your creativity as an influencer, and impresses your brand with outstanding results in the process.</p>
<div id="attachment_111" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-111" class="size-full wp-image-111" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-rudymancuso.jpg" alt="How to make money on Instagram - creative sponsored posts" width="1000" height="577" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-rudymancuso.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-rudymancuso-300x173.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-rudymancuso-768x443.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-111" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of rudymancuso (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Musician Rudy Mancuso did just this in his sponsored ad for <strong>Lucasfilm’s and HP’s </strong>new campaign collaboration. In his post, he creates his own version of the Star Wars theme using the new HP x360.</p>
<h3>Monetizing Instagram Though Brand Deals – The Wrong Way</h3>
<p>It’s also important to consider your personal support for the brand, and how well their products tie in to your overall message and persona. Users aren’t dense, and can generally pick up on <strong>inauthenticity</strong> when they see it. This was the case with fashion, beauty, and lifestyle blogger Chriselle Lim, who was slammed by fans for her ingenuine advertising of the automotive brand, Volvo.</p>
<div id="attachment_101" style="width: 870px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-101" class="size-full wp-image-101" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-chriselle-lim-marketing-fail.png" alt="Monetizing Instagram the wrong way - chrisellelim" width="860" height="469" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-chriselle-lim-marketing-fail.png 860w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-chriselle-lim-marketing-fail-300x164.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-chriselle-lim-marketing-fail-768x419.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /><p id="caption-attachment-101" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of chrisellelim (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Commenters were quick to point out the overly staged and ingenuine nature of her post. Compared to her usual content, it all just seemed out of place. Lesson learned: be sure you and your brand sponsorship are a good fit, lest it quickly turns into awkward, untrustworthy advertising for your followers.</p>
<h2>How To Make Money On Instagram #2 – Join An Affiliate Network</h2>
<p>If you’re yet to be sponsored by another brand, perhaps joining an <strong>affiliate network </strong>can bolster your image as an influencer.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate networks </strong>are online marketplaces comprised of companies that sell a product or service. Here, merchants provide influencers or bloggers with <strong>affiliate programs </strong>that enable these individuals to sell their products for a commission.</p>
<div id="attachment_114" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114" class="size-full wp-image-114" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shareasale-affiliate-marketing.png" alt="How to make money on Instagram - affiliate marketing" width="1000" height="838" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shareasale-affiliate-marketing.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shareasale-affiliate-marketing-300x251.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shareasale-affiliate-marketing-768x644.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-114" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of ShareASale.</p></div>
<p>Upon joining a program, you’ll then gain access to the available products and services you can promote from the company.</p>
<div id="attachment_96" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96" class="size-full wp-image-96" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-amazon-associates.png" alt="Get paid on Instagram through affiliate marketing - Amazon Associates" width="1000" height="450" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-amazon-associates.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-amazon-associates-300x135.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-amazon-associates-768x346.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-96" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Amazon Associates.</p></div>
<p>Each provides you with its very own affiliate link, which you can then promote on your Instagram. This leads your viewers to the corresponding product page. If you sell the product well and they end up buying a product, the merchant is informed of this sale, and you get a commission.</p>
<div id="attachment_121" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121" class="size-full wp-image-121" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-theskincarebeach.png" alt="Instagram affiliate links" width="1000" height="624" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-theskincarebeach.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-theskincarebeach-300x187.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-theskincarebeach-768x479.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-121" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of theskincarebeach (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>If this sounds like a profitable path for you, popular affiliate networks to get you started include <strong>ShareASale, Amazon Associates, </strong>and <strong>Rakuten Marketing.</strong> As with brand sponsorships, it’s best to have a focused niche for your business profile, and to promote products that best suit your brand and message.</p>
<h2>How To Make Money On Instagram #3 – Selling Your Own Product</h2>
<p>Of course, if you’ve got your very own product or service to sell, Instagram marketing is the way to go.</p>
<p>Rather than heading down the “influencer” route – which often involve crafting an appealing personal image and lifestyle – other users set up a profile for sole business purposes, marketing their goods off the bat with a professional brand image.</p>
<div id="attachment_91" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91" class="size-full wp-image-91" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-dollarshaveclub.png" alt="How to make money on Instagram - dollarshaveclub" width="1000" height="639" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-dollarshaveclub.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-dollarshaveclub-300x192.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/buy-followers-for-instagram-get-instagram-followers-dollarshaveclub-768x491.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-91" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of dollarshaveclub (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>To monetize your Instagram with this method, you must firstly create an online store. While some may opt to set up their own e-commerce website, others can make use of platforms for online entrepreneurs; such as <strong>Etsy </strong>or <strong>Shopify.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_116" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116" class="size-full wp-image-116" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche.jpg" alt="Get paid on Instagram by selling your own products" width="1000" height="680" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche-300x204.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche-768x522.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-116" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of small_peche (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Your regular feed thus becomes a space for advertising the contents of your store, whether through high-quality product photos, creative marketing videos, or user-generated content (i.e. re-sharing sponsored posts from influencers you may work with).</p>
<div id="attachment_117" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117" class="size-full wp-image-117" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche-feed.png" alt="Get paid on Instagram by selling your own products" width="1000" height="815" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche-feed.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche-feed-300x245.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-small_peche-feed-768x626.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-117" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of small_peche (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>To direct traffic to your actual store, you can simply leave a link in your bio or photo captions.</p>
<h3>Get Paid On Instagram Through Instagram Shopping</h3>
<p>Users who choose to sell through <strong>Shopify or BigCommerce </strong>are in luck – a recent Instagram feature now allows for users to turn their feed into a shopping experience.</p>
<p>With <strong>Shopping on Instagram, </strong>businesses can add <strong>product tags </strong>to their posts (or <strong>product stickers </strong>on their Stories). These tags give viewers a quick glance of how much the item costs. When tapped, the viewer is directed to a product description page providing further images and information on the product. This page also provides a link to your online store.</p>
<div id="attachment_115" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115" class="size-full wp-image-115" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shopping-on-instagram-shopify-app-store.png" alt="Monetize Instagram with Shopping on Instagram feature" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shopping-on-instagram-shopify-app-store.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shopping-on-instagram-shopify-app-store-300x169.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-shopping-on-instagram-shopify-app-store-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-115" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Shopify app.</p></div>
<p>To take advantage of this, businesses must have a corresponding Facebook page, must be selling <em>physical </em>goods, and have a <strong>Facebook Catalog</strong> set up through Facebook’s Business Manager or through the e-commerce platform they’re a part of.</p>
<h3>Monetizing Instagram By Selling Your Photos</h3>
<p>Instagram is an especially handy tool for <strong>photographers </strong>looking to make a profit. Being the visual gallery that it is, your profile operates like a <strong>public portfolio,</strong> showcasing your talent and eye for stunning images.</p>
<div id="attachment_108" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" class="size-full wp-image-108" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-johnnydegelder-photography.jpg" alt="How to make money on Instagram - selling your photos" width="1000" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-johnnydegelder-photography.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-johnnydegelder-photography-300x240.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-johnnydegelder-photography-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-108" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of johnnydegelder (Instagram account).</p></div>

<h2>How To Make Money On Instagram #4 – Advertising Events</h2>
<p>Finally, as an incredibly popular and active social platform, Instagram is a highly effective network for <strong>advertising any events</strong> you may be hosting.</p>
<div id="attachment_118" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" class="size-full wp-image-118" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-superduperkyle-advertising-event.png" alt="How to make money on Instagram - advertising events" width="1000" height="731" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-superduperkyle-advertising-event.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-superduperkyle-advertising-event-300x219.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-superduperkyle-advertising-event-768x561.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-118" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of superduperkyle (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>Once again, having an established following helps; the more people already interested in your brand and content, the higher your event turnout will be.</p>
<p>However, through the use of hashtags and location tags, you can easily advertise your event to potential followers who are yet to discover your business. Run a successful marketing campaign on the platform – and you’ll be raking in plenty of ticket sales!</p>

<h3>Create Hype Through Story Countdowns</h3>
<p>Other than the standard Instagram photo or video, Stories are also highly useful for generating hype. More specifically, the “Countdown” stickers provided by Instagram Stories helps remind interested users of an upcoming event, keeping them excited for a forthcoming product launches or special occasions.</p>
<div id="attachment_106" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-106" class="size-full wp-image-106" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-dj.amil_-countdown.jpg" alt="Using Stories to generate event hype" width="449" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-dj.amil_-countdown.jpg 449w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-make-money-on-instagram-monetize-instagram-dj.amil_-countdown-168x300.jpg 168w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /><p id="caption-attachment-106" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of dj.amil_ (Instagram account).</p></div>
