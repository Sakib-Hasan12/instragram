								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;re looking for a tool that can increase your audience on Instagram and you came across Stim Social.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering if Stim Social is worth it. Does it really work? Is it safe? Does it include any unique features?</p>
<p>To save you the hassle of trying out the tool, I made an account, linked it to a test Instagram profile, and played around with it for a few days.</p>
<p>In this Stim Social review, I&#8217;ll share my experience with you. When you&#8217;re done, you&#8217;ll know exactly what to expect from this tool.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start.</p>
<h2>What is Stim Social?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1732 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="355" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks.jpg 966w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks-300x212.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/howstimsocialworks-768x544.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>There are many different types of Instagram automation tools, such as full-on bots, tools that only perform one action, and ones that link you with social media marketers. Where does Stim Social fit in?</p>
<p>Stim Social is an Instagram bot but it only automates a handful of tasks. One of the headlines on their website promises to send real, active, and engaged followers to your Instagram.</p>
<p>It can automate the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow</li>
<li>Unfollow</li>
<li>Like (called Engagement Like on their platform)</li>
</ul>
<p>They claim users can rapidly build a legitimate audience on Instagram by automating these three tasks. On top of that, the tool also provides you with detailed analytics, so you can watch your account growth in real-time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what most of these Instagram bots promise. Is Stim Social the one that really works?</p>
<h2>Stim Social&#8217;s Reputation Online</h2>
<p>Bear in mind, Stim Social is not the most popular Instagram tool.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t so many reviews about it online. On the other hand, there is an unclaimed Trust Pilot page that &#8211; unfortunately &#8211; has mostly negative reviews on it. Right now it has 14 reviews, and 86% of them are bad.</p>
<p>Look:</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-1727 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="208" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot.jpg 859w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot-300x104.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsocialtrustpilot-768x266.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a great sign. Especially considering most of the user reviews mention similar downsides, which we&#8217;ll discuss in the cons section of this review.</p>
<h2>Stim Social&#8217;s Features</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering if this tool has the features you need to boost your audience growth.</p>
<p>If you visited their webpage, then you have probably noticed they&#8217;re suspiciously vague about the included features. In fact, they&#8217;re vague about the price too.</p>
<p>After playing around with the free trial, I discovered most of the tool&#8217;s features. What it boils down to are three core services: auto-follow, auto unfollow, and engagement likes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t that impressed. Most of the features are the same as found on other bots, and lacking in several ways too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let&#8217;s run through them.</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Auto Follow &amp; Targets</h3>
<p>Most Instagram bots have an auto-follow service, and it&#8217;s a rather basic one at this point. Naturally, to start this service, you&#8217;ll need to add proper targets first. Stim Social has a decent amount of targets.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Competitor Profiles</li>
<li>Hashtags</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Business Accounts</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Private Accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>If you add appropriate targets, the bot shouldn&#8217;t have a problem finding accounts to interact with. Most people report their accounts did grow after using the tool for a few days.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Configuring Interaction Limits</h3>
<p>Most of these limits are set to default values, but you can adjust them as you see fit. Custom limits are available for the main three actions: following, unfollowing, and liking.</p>
<p>Another filter you can add limits to is called Post Limits which only interacts with users who have a certain number of posts.</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Auto Likes</h3>
<p>At the moment, Stim Social likes content in two ways; like a user&#8217;s most recent post, or like content in your profiles feed at random. You can change the liking service in the settings menu.</p>
<p>The liking service works with the other auto services, using the same targets, and leaves a like on profiles it comes across.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind this service isn&#8217;t the highlight of Stim Social&#8217;s service, it&#8217;s more like an add-on.</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Adjust the Speed</h3>
<p>On the dashboard, you&#8217;ll notice you can change the speed of the services. The problem is the faster speeds are behind a paywall. If you want a faster service, then you&#8217;ll have to subscribe to the right plan.</p>
<p>Here are the speeds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Turbo</li>
<li>Extreme</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about the subscription plans in the pricing section.</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Detailed Growth Analytics</h3>
<p>One feature that makes this tool stand out from the rest is the detailed reports. There are reports for a couple of things, such as Engagement Reports and Targeting Reports.</p>
<p>These reports show the data you might expect. The engagement report shows the engagement that your last 12 posts receive.</p>
<p>The targeting report can reveal some interesting data. It shows you how each of your individual targets is performing and it also assigns a quality score to the users. The report will also reveal the number of follow-backs you receive, as well as other interactions such as likes and comments.</p>
<h3>6 &#8211; Clean Feed</h3>
<p>Stim Social&#8217;s Clean Feed service is only available on Turbo and Extreme memberships. Essentially, what it does is mute the accounts the tool interacts with on your behalf to keep your Instagram feed clean. It&#8217;s a useful service. You can also choose to unmute the new followers if you want to view their content too.</p>
<h3>7 &#8211; Story Views</h3>
<p>Another automated service that views the stories of specific accounts or accounts with target parameters. Story Views is useful because the creators of those stories can see your account in their list of story views. It&#8217;s another way to send out a &#8220;Ping&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<h2>How Much is Stim Social?</h2>
<p>Stim Social has three main subscription plans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fast &#8211; $9.95/month</li>
<li>Turbo &#8211; $19.95/month</li>
<li>Extreme &#8211; $29.95/month</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few other add-ons you can choose, such as Engagement Pack and Direct Messages.</p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1734 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsociasignup.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="482" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsociasignup.jpg 565w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stimsociasignup-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></p>
<h3>What is The Engagement Pack?</h3>
<p>While looking at the prices, you have probably noticed the plans on the pricier end have a service called Engagement Pack. The Engagement Pack adds a new service to the mix, an auto-direct message service, and an additional report, called Top Engagers Report.</p>
<p>The auto direct message service supports up to 10 custom written messages, selected at random. And the Top Engager Report shows who your top fans are, so you can better understand your audience. Overall, a useful package.</p>
<p>P.S. Wondering how to organically <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/post-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">improve your engagement on Instagram?</a></p>
<h2>Stim Social Pros</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re familiar with the features, we&#8217;ll run through our list of pros.</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; 5 Day Free Trial 👍</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice when a tool offers a free trial period. Stim Social offers an entire week of free usage, which is great. No credit card required, and no hidden charges.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Decent Amount of Targets 👍</h3>
<p>You can filter accounts based on the three main channels; competition, hashtags, and location. There are also the minor target filters we mentioned earlier. Overall, an okay amount of filters to work with.</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Simple User Interface 👍</h3>
<p>No need to spend hours configuring individual services and locating the appropriate menus. Stim Social streamlines the user interface to the point where you only need to worry about toggling services. It&#8217;s very easy to use. Very user-friendly!</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Works Online (No Need to Download and Install) 👍</h3>
<p>Another thing I liked about this tool is you don&#8217;t have to download and install any software. The bot runs on their servers. You don&#8217;t have to worry about hosting anything with virtual private servers and whatnot. It makes things very convenient.</p>
<h3>5 &#8211; Set Your Own Limits 👍</h3>
<p>Think the bot is creating too much activity? Following too many accounts? Head over to the settings and limit the number of actions it can perform. It&#8217;s nice to have the option to manually change the limits of various services.</p>
<h3>6 &#8211; Good Reporting Tools 👍</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to see watch your profile&#8217;s growth. Stim Social offers a decent number of reporting tools. You can track all kinds of data, from new followers to conversion rates and engagement rates. The add-on Top Engagers report is useful too.</p>
<h2>Stim Social Cons</h2>
<p>On the flip side, here&#8217;s what we didn&#8217;t like:</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Slow Support 👎</h3>
<p>Remember the Trust Pilot ratings from earlier? Most of the people leaving negative reviews for Stim Social mention the support takes a long time to reply to emails.</p>
<p>At the moment, they only offer email support, there&#8217;s no hotline or live-chat service. They do have a support page where you can find basic information about the tool but if you need help with a specific issue, it could be a while before you receive a response.</p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Not Very Transparent 👎</h3>
<p>On their website, they like to keep things details very vague. Their pricing page isn&#8217;t even public! There&#8217;s no mention of the tool being a bot or any of the auto-services either.</p>
<p>The headlines are: &#8220;Attract New Followers, Drive Site Traffic, Build Your Influence, Increase Product Sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very little information on how they are going to do that. The support page provides more information, but I would prefer not to have to browse through their knowledge base to find basic information that should be on the front page of their website.</p>
<p>You get the impression that the company is trying to hide something from the public. There&#8217;s also no about page!</p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Unreliable Performance 👎</h3>
<p>Another common complaint about Stim Social is regarding the performance. Many users claim that the tool worked great up until a certain point, and then it stopped working altogether.</p>
<p>Ironically, it seems like the free trial works better than the paid memberships. There are lots of complaints from people who bought a plan only to discover the bot refused to work.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some times people would notice far too much activity on their accounts. It seems like the performance is unreliable and not consistent.</p>
<h3>4 &#8211; Can&#8217;t Use Account When Bot is Active 👎</h3>
<p>One thing to remember, that isn&#8217;t clear on their website, is you shouldn&#8217;t interact with your Instagram account when the bot is active.</p>
<p>This is can be a dealbreaker for social media marketers who always need to keep up with direct messages and other actions that this bot doesn&#8217;t automate. But they warn if you use the bot while also connected on your phone, it could lead to a block-out.</p>
<h2>Is Stim Social Worth It?</h2>
<p>To summarize, while Stim Social provides an okay service, it&#8217;s not something we can confidently recommend. I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as other reviewers and call it a straight-up scam. It worked well enough for me. But I feel like there are much better alternatives out there. Stim Social felt like a stripped-down version of other Instagram bots.</p>
<h2>Stim Social Alternatives</h2>
<p>Speaking of alternatives, there are two tools that come to mind.</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1 &#8211; Kenji </a></h3>
<p>Kenji is a really interesting little Instagram bot that is also great for people on a budget. The bot uses machine learning to create a portfolio of activity based on your interactions.</p>
<p>It has plenty of anti-bot detection filters too, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about getting your account blocked from Instagram. Very interesting bot. And it has a free 3-day trial, no credit card required.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">2 &#8211; Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Upleap is a little pricier, but their service is well worth it. The way Upleap works is it links you to social media managers which perform actions on your accounts, based on your requests.</p>
<p>The great thing about Upleap is it&#8217;s not technically a bot. It&#8217;s kind of like putting your account in the hands of a professional social media marketer, so the risk of being blocked is minimal. You can also try it for free for three days.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Stim Social review. I hope this review cleared up some of your questions about the software and helped point you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<p>Using an Instagram bot always comes with a certain level of risk. When it comes to using Instagram bots you need to use common sense and be careful. Make sure the speed settings are low, at least at first, and don&#8217;t spam your account with too many actions.</p>
<p>While Instagram probably won&#8217;t straight up ban you if they find out you&#8217;re using a bot, they&#8217;ll keep asking you to change your password or lock you out, which can be a frustrating experience. Although Instagram bots can save you a lot of time, they are risky, so use at your own risk.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re building a business or brand on Instagram, your analytics should play a vital role in your overall marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s analytics offer valuable data on your current content performance; helping you craft better ways of growing your account and connecting with the right audiences.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an aspect of the platform that can&#8217;t be ignored &#8211;  especially for those developing an audience. The following guide breaks down the fundamentals of Instagram analytics, why they&#8217;re important, and the best tools for tracking such information.</p>
<h2>What are Instagram Analytics?</h2>
<p>Instagram analytics are a native feature on the platform. These stats offer users insight on their current content strategy, and how well it&#8217;s performing with their target audience.</p>
<p>Through your analytics, you&#8217;ll get a clear image of the type of content that works best, the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns, and demographics you resonate with most.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1649" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen.jpg" alt="Person analyzing graph" width="1000" height="499" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-analytics-graph-pen-768x383.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>This data isn&#8217;t just available for standard posts, however; users can also measure the performance of their Story and ad content.</p>
<p>Your analytics track information such as follower growth; content reach, engagement, and impressions; and the number of clickthroughs on your website URL.</p>
<h2>Why Do Instagram Analytics Matter?</h2>
<p>By keeping track of your analytics, you can then take the appropriate steps to improve your content quality and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>This data helps you understand what your audience likes and dislikes. Do your followers respond better to video content? What recent posts have lead to surges in engagement? Did a change in theme, subject matter, or brand image land well with your current audience, or did it fall short of previous content?</p>
<div id="attachment_1646" style="width: 1319px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1646" class="size-full wp-image-1646" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare.png" alt="Analytics tools for Instagram - Iconosquare" width="1309" height="499" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare.png 1309w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-300x114.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-768x293.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-iconosquare-1024x390.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1309px) 100vw, 1309px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1646" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Iconosquare.</p></div>
<p>It can also offer insight into the type of value your profile drives. Does your bio URL generate enough website traffic? Perhaps you gain high engagement on your posts &#8211; but not enough clickthroughs to your onli<span style="font-size: 1rem;">ne store. According to this data, you may need more engaging call-to-actions.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1674" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse.jpg" alt="Woman using computer mouse" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse-300x150.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/woman-using-computer-mouse-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Understanding these analytical trends and patterns can help you refine your content strategy. In a sea of over <a href="https://business.instagram.com/getting-started?ref=igb_carousel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">25 million business profiles</a>, this constant improvement is necessary to keep ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>So how does one track their Instagram Analytics?</p>
<h2>A Guide to Instagram Insights</h2>
<p>Your Instagram Insights provide plenty of built-in tools to help you measure your profile analytics, along with your audience and post metrics.</p>
<p>This native feature is exclusive to <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-business-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">business profiles</a> (if you&#8217;re looking to grow your brand on the platform, having an Instagram business account is crucial!), and is found in your profile menu at the top right-hand corner of your screen.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1650 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights.png" alt="Analytics tools for instagram - Instagram Insights" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-300x165.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-768x422.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Here, you&#8217;ll find your insights divided into three sections: <strong>Content, Activity, </strong>and<strong> Audience. </strong></p>
<p>Your &#8220;Content&#8221; tab tracks all of the recent posts and stories you&#8217;ve uploaded during the week, with detailed insights (such as reach, impressions, and likes) provided for each.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1659 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-content.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Content tab" width="436" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-content.png 436w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-content-164x300.png 164w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /></p>
<p>Under &#8220;Activity&#8221;, you&#8217;ll find weekly data on the any interactions taken on your content or profile. These stats will offer an analytical report on the days that garnered the most activity, along with the total number of accounts that have discovered your account in the previous week.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1651" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity.png" alt="Instagram metrics - profile activity" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity-300x165.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-activity-768x422.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Finally, your &#8220;Audience&#8221; tab displays your total number of followers and overall weekly growth. With recent updates to Instagram Insights, this section now shows graphed data on the number of follows and unfollows you&#8217;ve gained during the week.</p>

<p>These insights also offer information on your most engaged demographics, including stats regarding gender, location, and age range.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1658 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age.png" alt="Instagram metrics - Audience insights" width="480" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age.png 480w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-audience-locations-age-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>One of the most valuable metrics provided is your followers&#8217; most active times &#8211; displayed by the hour or day (depending on your preference). Using this data, you can ensure future posts are uploaded during optimum times of engagement.</p>

<h2>The Top Instagram Metrics to Track</h2>
<p>To improve your content strategy, you&#8217;ll need a grasp of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. This is why analytics play such a vital role in your Instagram efforts &#8211; but which metrics are the most important ones to follow?</p>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ve broken down the top three Instagram metrics any profile should be tracking. These help best in measuring content performance and planning strategies for further success.</p>
<h3>Follower Growth</h3>
<p>Chances are, when you think of building your profile &#8211; the agitating <em><strong>follower count </strong></em>comes to mind. This simple number plays a large factor in your overall content engagement and brand reputation.</p>
<p>The more followers you have, the more likes, comments, and views your content will get. With a high follower count, new viewers are also more likely to trust your profile, and view it as one of quality &#8211; possibly joining the club themselves.</p>
<div id="attachment_1661" style="width: 731px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1661" class="size-full wp-image-1661" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-followers.png" alt="@johnmayer - followers" width="721" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-followers.png 721w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-followers-270x300.png 270w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1661" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of johnmayer (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>It&#8217;s therefore important to not only keep track of the followers you currently have, but your follower growth <strong>over time. </strong>This will let you know if you&#8217;re on the right track, or if something needs to change in your current content strategy.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1660" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-followers.png" alt="Instagram metrics - followers" width="615" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-followers.png 615w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-analytics-instagram-insights-followers-230x300.png 230w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px" /></p>
<p>For example, if the previous months have shown a steady increase in followers, then you&#8217;re likely doing something right. However, if your growth tends to fluctuate at an odd pattern &#8211; it may be worth examining the content or marketing-related reasons behind this.</p>
<p>From this data, you can then make further decisions to improve or change your marketing strategy altogether.</p>
<h3>Reach, Impressions, and Engagement</h3>
<p>When analyzing the success of your content, it helps to track these three fundamental metrics:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1662" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions.png" alt="Instagram metrics - reach and impressions" width="1000" height="386" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions-300x116.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagam-metrics-reach-impressions-768x296.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reach: </strong>Your reach rate is measured by the number of unique users who viewed your posts, Stories, ads, and videos. This helps determine your content exposure, and whether you&#8217;ve been reaching new audiences on the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Impressions: </strong>These measure the total number of times your content was seen by viewers, and include multiple views by a single user.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement: </strong>Arguably the most important metric of the three, engagement covers the number of unique profiles that have commented, liked, saved, or shared your content. Your engagement rate, however, does not count multiple comments by a single user.</li>
</ul>
<h4>On Standard Posts</h4>
<p>To view these metrics on a typical Instagram post, simply tap on the post you wish to analyze, and select the &#8220;View Insights&#8221; option underneath.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1669 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-analytics-view-insights.png" alt="Instagram post - &quot;View Insights&quot;" width="576" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-analytics-view-insights.png 576w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-analytics-view-insights-216x300.png 216w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /></p>
<p>This will pop up all the likes, comments, shares, and saves your post has garnered over time. Here, you&#8217;ll find data on your reach and total impressions; including a breakdown of the sources from where your content was seen, such as the home feed, your hashtags, and your profile.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1671 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-post-insights.png" alt="Instagram analytics - post insights" width="454" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-post-insights.png 454w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-post-insights-170x300.png 170w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></p>
<p>These insights also count the number of profile visits driven from your posts.</p>
<p>To display multiple insights for multiple posts, enter your Instagram Insights and select &#8220;See All&#8221; in the &#8220;Content&#8221; section.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1652 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-content-see-all.png" alt="Instagram Insights - &quot;See all&quot; posts" width="745" height="802" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-content-see-all.png 745w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-content-see-all-279x300.png 279w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" /></p>
<p>This will pull up a feed of your posts, each displaying their reach numbers by default.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1653 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-feed-posts.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Feed posts" width="480" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-feed-posts.png 480w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-feed-posts-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>You can filter these posts by type, metric, and time period according to your preference.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1670 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-insights-feed-posts-filter.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Filtering feed posts" width="446" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-insights-feed-posts-filter.png 446w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-insights-feed-posts-filter-167x300.png 167w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px" /></p>
<h4>Stories</h4>
<p>Similarly, your Instagram Insights can also provide the reach, impressions, and engagement rates of your Stories. These are accessed in the &#8220;Stories&#8221; section under &#8220;Posts&#8221; in your Insights page.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1655 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagement.png" alt="Analytics tools for Instagram - Story insights" width="768" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagement.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagement-288x300.png 288w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>By default, this page shows a feed of Story insights from the last 14 days. As with standard posts, however, you can filter through these by metric or time period (though 14 days back is the farthest these insights will cover).</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1654 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-stories-filter.png" alt="Instagram Insights - Filtering story posts" width="440" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-stories-filter.png 440w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-instagram-insights-stories-filter-165x300.png 165w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" /></p>
<p>Unlike a typical Instagram post, Story engagements can also be measured by the number of viewers that who viewed your next story, who tapped back to view a previous story, who swiped over to view the next user&#8217;s story, or who exited from the feature altogether.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1656 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagements.png" alt="Analytics tools for Instagram - Story insights" width="430" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagements.png 430w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/analytics-tools-for-instagram-story-engagements-161x300.png 161w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<p>These can help you determine how engaging your Story content is, and material that may have lost audience attention.</p>
<h3>Website Traffic</h3>
<p>Since the advent of Shopping on Instagram, consumer experience on the platform has never been more convenient. Now, store profiles can add product stickers right onto their Stories or posts. When tapped, these tags direct the viewer to the appropriate landing page on the brand&#8217;s official website.</p>
<div id="attachment_1673" style="width: 493px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1673" class="size-full wp-image-1673" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shopping-stickers-instagram-post-welovecolorscosplay.png" alt="@welovecolorscosplay - Shopping stickers on Instagram posts" width="483" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shopping-stickers-instagram-post-welovecolorscosplay.png 483w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shopping-stickers-instagram-post-welovecolorscosplay-181x300.png 181w" sizes="(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1673" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of welovecolorscosplay (Instagram account).</p></div>
<p>If your goal on Instagram is converting customers and boosting sales, you&#8217;d want to ensure your content does just that.<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Viewing insights for your shoppable content is as easy as tapping the &#8220;View Insights&#8221; option on standard posts, and swiping up on a Story to view its engagement data. </span></p>
<p>This can help you determine which posts (and thus, which products) generate the most clickthroughs to your website. In the same vein, it can also identify the products that aren&#8217;t resonating as well with audiences.</p>
<p>Your Instagram Insights also offers basic data on the website traffic driven from your bio URL. Under the &#8220;Interactions&#8221; section, you&#8217;ll find a metric labelled &#8220;Website Clicks&#8221;, along with the corresponding number of website visits drawn from the link in your bio.</p>
<div id="attachment_1672" style="width: 1134px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1672" class="size-full wp-image-1672" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later.jpeg" alt="Instagram analytics - website clicks (Later)" width="1124" height="1978" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later.jpeg 1124w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later-170x300.jpeg 170w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later-768x1352.jpeg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-metrics-website-clicks-later-582x1024.jpeg 582w" sizes="(max-width: 1124px) 100vw, 1124px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1672" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>

<h2>Use Instagram Analytics to Skyrocket Your Growth!</h2>
<p>Keeping track of your Instagram analytics is crucial to growing your brand on the platform. While Instagram&#8217;s native tools offer plenty of free, user-friendly data, these third-party tools can offer in-depth information to further sharpen your marketing strategy. Growing your profile needn&#8217;t be a stab in the dark; use Instagram analytics to build your audience and engagement with research-backed confidence.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were active in the internet marketing world a couple of years ago, chances are you have heard about Massplanner. Since the shutdown, many marketers are scrambling to find an equal alternative.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll talk about Massplanner, its features, why it was popular, and then move on to some of our recommended alternatives.</p>
<p>Before we get into that, let&#8217;s talk about why Massplanner was shut down.</p>
<h2>Why Was Massplanner Shut Down?</h2>
<p><img class=" wp-image-1978 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="196" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown.jpg 806w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown-300x98.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerdown-768x251.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>At some point in 2017 when marketers tried to visit the Massplanner website they were met with the notice that says &#8220;Sorry, our service is discontinued&#8221;. It still remains today.</p>
<p>As you probably know, Instagram doesn&#8217;t want third-party tools using the words &#8220;Insta&#8221; or &#8220;Gram&#8221; in their names. This is one of the most common reasons for Instagram to file a lawsuit against Instagram bots.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Massplanner didn&#8217;t seem to violate that rule. However, after a closer look, it becomes quite clear why Instagram filed a lawsuit against Massplanner.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Massplanner not only has services to automate a wide range of Instagram activity but also create fake accounts using proxies. These fake accounts were basically sold and used as like-farms and whatnot, something that Instagram clearly doesn&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>In short, it broke too many of Instagram&#8217;s rules. Most bots can get away with breaking a couple, or at least working within a grey-area, but Massplanner went all out.</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact Massplanner was one of the most popular tools for black-hat marketers, it&#8217;s not surprising Instagram took action. Discussions about the tool are still quite popular on internet marketing forums, such as Warrior Forum and Black Hat World.</p>
<h2>What Made Massplanner Special?</h2>
<p><img class="wp-image-1977 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplanneradvertisement.jpg" alt="" width="501" height="478" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplanneradvertisement.jpg 562w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplanneradvertisement-300x286.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering why this tool was so popular when there are so many other similar tools out there. From what I can tell, there are several reasons for that. For starters, Massplanner had so many features.</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automate activity on every social media platform (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, etc)</li>
<li>Auto-follow &amp; Unfollow Users</li>
<li>Schedule and Upload Content</li>
<li>Mass-Account Creator</li>
<li>Auto Comment</li>
<li>Direct Message</li>
<li>Auto Like</li>
<li>And many others.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, it was a full-scale Instagram bot, with almost every possible feature.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, not all the features were included in the core price.</p>
<h2>How Did It Work?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1979" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures.jpg" alt="" width="1332" height="600" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures.jpg 1332w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures-300x135.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures-768x346.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/massplannerfeatures-1024x461.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1332px) 100vw, 1332px" /></p>
<p>Look, Massplanner was a software, a Windows application to be specific. You had to download and install it on your computer or a virtual private server.</p>
<p>You weren&#8217;t allowed to use the program on more than one computer and you were supposed to use a proxy to avoid detection. In other words, your computer needed to be on for the tool to work.</p>
<p>There are still a lot of tools out there that use a similar system, one that comes to mind is Jarvee. <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/jarvee/" data-wpel-link="internal">Read our detailed Jarvee review here.</a></p>
<p>Getting started with Massplaner was much the same as tools you might be familiar with now. Users would have to enter their Follow Sources, which are keywords, hashtags, or other users. These settings create a starting point for the bot.</p>
<p>Once you did that, all that&#8217;s left to do is hit the Start Auto Follow button and watch the live activity.</p>
<p>Massplanner catered more towards advanced marketers. It had a wide range of services that were not found in other Instagram bots, at least not at that time.</p>
<p>It also had plenty of filters. You could customize the settings of almost every action, including wait periods. When used correctly, Instagram would have a hard time figuring out if you&#8217;re using a bot or not.</p>
<p>Here are some of the filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait between actions (set a custom time)</li>
<li>Follow during certain hours of the day</li>
<li>Follow a range of people</li>
<li>Add random intervals to pause the bot</li>
<li>Wait a certain amount of seconds between each follow</li>
<li>A random sleep timer</li>
<li>Add follow limits</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Much Did Massplanner Cost?</h2>
<p>To start with, they offered a 5-day free trial.</p>
<p>After that, there were a handful of paid memberships to choose from, starting from $9.95 a month for the basic version. A six-month license costs $44.95.</p>
<p>There were also some add-on modules, such as Instagram Poster, InstaChat, Multi-Account Module, Bump, and many others. These were add-ons for specific social media platforms.</p>
<p>Overall, it wasn&#8217;t pricey. In fact, it was quite affordable, which may be why so many people were drawn to it.</p>
<h2>What Happened When Massplanner Shutdown?</h2>
<p>The news that Massplanner closed their doors came as a shock. Nobody was really expecting it, and many marketers were using the tool for their business.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at that time, Instagram was cracking down on these kinds of tools, and many other tools had to close down as well. The people who were using Massplanner rushed to other tools, only to have those shut down as well.</p>
<p>You can tell how upset some people were by the number of discussions about this issue on internet marketing forums. Well, there some things we can learn from this situation.</p>
<h3>What We Can Learn From This:</h3>
<p>Truth be told, using any type of social media automation comes with risks. Granted, they can save you a lot of time as well, but nothing lasts forever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always best not to rely too heavily on social media automation tools. Instagram bots have their uses, but you shouldn&#8217;t depend on them entirely. At least have backup tools to fall on when one shuts down.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the reasons Massplanner shut down was because marketers were getting a bit too greedy and pushing the limits. They created and managed thousands of accounts with the tool, selling Instagram likes and other interactions to people online.</p>
<h3>Too Many Spammers:</h3>
<p>Essentially, Massplanner was the source of a lot of spam. Instagram doesn&#8217;t like spam. Not many people do. Massplanner was used to not only create thousands of fake accounts but manage those accounts too.</p>
<p>What ended up happening is various marketers had armies of accounts creating spam. It&#8217;s no wonder Instagram caught on quick.</p>
<p>Look, if you&#8217;re going to use an Instagram automation tool, take it really slow at first. New accounts need to keep the activity looking as human as possible. Don&#8217;t start spamming all the services at once.</p>
<h3>There Are Always Risks:</h3>
<p>And you also need to remember, even if you follow all the recommendations, and continue to use bots, there&#8217;s still the off chance that you&#8217;ll be blocked. Instagram doesn&#8217;t usually ban users for weird activity, not immediately at least, but repeat offenders will eventually be banned.</p>
<p>I think if Massplanner only offered a few services and places strict limits on its users, the company would probably still be up and running today. Then again, it probably wouldn&#8217;t have been as popular.</p>
<p>Overall, though, if you pay close attention to the tool&#8217;s tutorials and advice, then the chances of you running into trouble are minimal.</p>
<h2>Looking for a Massplanner Alternative?</h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear picture, here are alternatives to Massplanner.</p>
<p>The tool that is most similar to Massplanner is Jarvee, but it&#8217;s not something we recommend for complete beginners. Like Massplanner, it has a ton of features and settings which can be overwhelming for new marketers.</p>
<p>So what do we recommend?</p>
<p>Out of all the<a href="//socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"> Instagram tools we love</a>, here are two of our favorites:</p>
<h3>1 &#8211; Kenji</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2147 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-1024x540.jpg" alt="Kenji.ai is an alternative to massplanner" width="1024" height="540" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-1024x540.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-300x158.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kenji.ai_-768x405.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>What we like most about Kenji is that it keeps things simple. The platform can be accessed online, so there&#8217;s no need to download any apps, and it is very easy to setup.</p>
<p>Basically, all you have to do is type in your targets and toggle the services you want, that&#8217;s it. Setup can be completed in minutes. It&#8217;s also budget-friendly!</p>
<p><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Click here to try a three-day trial. </a></p>
<h3>2 &#8211; Upleap</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2146 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-1024x510.png" alt="alternative for massplanner" width="1024" height="510" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-1024x510.png 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-300x149.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram-768x383.png 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/upleap-instagram.png 1698w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Upleap is a unique platform. What it does is pair you with an account manager who generates Instagram activity on your behalf. It&#8217;s the closest thing to hiring a full-time social media marketer for your account.</p>
<p>The difference is Upleap is much cheaper, and you can easily track the performance inside your dashboard. Upleap is our favorite Instagram automation tool. Granted, it&#8217;s not the cheapest, but it&#8217;s well worth it.</p>
<p><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Start the three-day trial. </a></p>
<h3>3 &#8211; Later</h3>
<p>Later is more of an Instagram manager than a bot. It doesn&#8217;t automate activity for you but it does allow you to schedule content. The platform has a really cool grid-style calendar that lets you schedule and publishes content for the entire year.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not the best Massplanner alternative, it&#8217;s worth mentioning because it can really benefit your social media activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://later.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Take a look. </a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal:</p>
<p>The above Instagram automation tools aren&#8217;t as aggressive as Massplanner. Unlike Massplanner, these tools only work with Instagram, no other social media platforms. They also don&#8217;t have the account-creator that Massplanner was known for.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you&#8217;re looking to organically grow your Instagram account, with the help of some automation tools, then these two of your best choices.</p>
<h2>Massplanner In Summary</h2>
<p>To summarize, Massplanner was a decent bot. It provides a high level of customization and features that most bots today don&#8217;t have. However, marketers flooded to the tool and used it a bit too aggressively. It wasn&#8217;t long before it appeared on Instagram&#8217;s radar and they took action against it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking if this happened to Massplanner, then chances are it can happen again to any automation tool. That it may be true. There are always risks. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend relying too heavily on any single tool.</p>
<p>A couple of pointers to keep in mind:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to avoid tools with the words &#8220;Gram&#8221; or &#8220;Insta&#8221; in their names. These will likely be the first to go when Instagram starts the ban-waves. Secondly, keep away from ones that mass-create accounts or sell followers. You can&#8217;t go wrong with one of our recommendations.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only so much a bot can do. You still need to be making quality content. Automation tools can help make the process easier, and save you time, but you&#8217;ll still need to do some work.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Massplanner review. I hope you learned something new and you choose one of our recommended Instagram automation tools. They&#8217;ll save you a lot of hassle!</p>
<p>Remember, when you use a tool that requires a lot of customization, it&#8217;s best to keep all the settings to the lowest possible, at least at first.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With over 1 billion active users, chances are, you&#8217;re using Instagram to widen your reach. With that said, you must utilize all its features. And while images work great, Instagram video is also becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>In fact, there are plenty of ways to use Instagram videos. With features like Instagram Stories, IGTV, and video ads, you have plenty of opportunities to create a solid Instagram video strategy.</p>
<div id="attachment_2079" style="width: 1027px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2079" class="size-full wp-image-2079" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sunday-Riley-IG-video-sample.jpg" alt="Sunday Riley IG video sample" width="1017" height="746" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sunday-Riley-IG-video-sample.jpg 1017w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sunday-Riley-IG-video-sample-300x220.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sunday-Riley-IG-video-sample-768x563.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2079" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @sundayriley via Instagram</p></div>
<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll provide tips and tricks to create killer Instagram videos. Plus, we&#8217;ll list the top Instagram video creator to help you get started!</p>
<h2>But Why Does Your Brand Need A Solid Instagram Video Marketing Strategy?</h2>
<p>According to Instagram, user-time spent watching Instagram videos increase more than <a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/welcoming-two-million-advertisers/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">80% year over year</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/instagram-marketing/instagram-statistics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">25% of Instagram ads are videos</a>.</p>
<p>Although images tend to have more engagement, users are more likely to respond to video ads. Additionally, users can now upload Instagram videos up to a minute long. Imagine what a 60-second video can do for your product!</p>
<p>Need more reasons to create Instagram videos?</p>
<h3>1. Convey More Of Your Brand Message</h3>
<p>They say a photo is worth a thousand words. With that said, a video can convey even more. For one, a solid IG video will help showcase your brand identity. In fact, you can create Instagram videos showcasing your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products and campaigns</li>
<li>Brand advocacies</li>
<li>Team and their stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wwf/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">WWF International</a> as an example. They use Instagram videos to raise awareness of their advocacies.</p>
<p>This post, in particular, urges their audience to make their voice heard for the planet.</p>
<div id="attachment_2052" style="width: 1177px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2052" class="size-full wp-image-2052" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-sample.jpg" alt="WWF instagram video sample" width="1167" height="756" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-sample.jpg 1167w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-sample-300x194.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-sample-768x498.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-sample-1024x663.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1167px) 100vw, 1167px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2052" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @wwf via Instagram</p></div>
<p>Another example is from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/everlane/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Everlane</a>, a retail company that uses sustainable practices to produce high-quality clothes. They pride themselves on being radically transparent.</p>
<div id="attachment_2053" style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2053" class="size-full wp-image-2053" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Everlan-Instagram-video-sample.jpg" alt="Everlane Instagram video sample" width="2250" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Everlan-Instagram-video-sample.jpg 2250w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Everlan-Instagram-video-sample-300x178.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Everlan-Instagram-video-sample-768x455.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Everlan-Instagram-video-sample-1024x607.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2053" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @everlane via Instagram</p></div>
<p>In these Instagram Stories, they talk about the &#8220;plastic problem&#8221;.</p>
<h2>2. Better Showcase Your Products</h2>
<p>According to statistics, <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/video-marketing-statistics#sm.00000xf8cec7ahdzxrzbs5v3hjg6k" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">54% of users</a> want to see more video content from brands. In fact, consumers are more likely to buy a product after watching a video first. <a href="https://animoto.com/blog/video-marketing/video-marketing-instagram/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram saw a huge increase in purchases</a> thanks to videos. Therefore, creating Instagram videos could potentially increase sales.</p>
<p>One example that comes to mind is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nocow/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">No Cow</a>. They are promoting their products as dairy-free, high protein, and have ridiculously low sugar.</p>
<div id="attachment_2058" style="width: 1176px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2058" class="size-full wp-image-2058" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/No-Cow-Instagram-video-sample.jpg" alt="No Cow Instagram video sample" width="1166" height="749" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/No-Cow-Instagram-video-sample.jpg 1166w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/No-Cow-Instagram-video-sample-300x193.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/No-Cow-Instagram-video-sample-768x493.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/No-Cow-Instagram-video-sample-1024x658.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1166px) 100vw, 1166px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2058" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @nocow via Instagram</p></div>
<p>They successfully combined a dose of wit and fun animated posts. Take this video as an example. It&#8217;s fairly simple with a lemon meringue pie being pushed out by their protein bar.</p>
<p>The caption states that their protein bar is the healthier choice. In doing so, they provided value to their audience without sounding too salesy.</p>
<p>If you want to get ahead of the competition, start creating a solid video marketing strategy. It&#8217;s an excellent tool to catch your audience&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3>3. Stand Out From Other Types of Content</h3>
<p>Remember, an IG video must be 60 seconds (or less) long. This is very different from a 3 to 30-minute video for your Youtube channel.</p>
<p>When you create Instagram videos, it needs to have a faster pace. In doing so, your audiences won&#8217;t simply scroll down their feed. But if done successfully, you&#8217;ll be able to stand out from the sea of content.</p>
<p>Take this example from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mango/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Mango</a>. They used a movie-like Instagram video to introduce a stunning new collection.</p>
<p>First, they added a short Instagram Story video that served as a teaser. When their audience &#8220;Swipes Up&#8221;, they will be redirected to their IGTV.</p>
<div id="attachment_2059" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2059" class="size-full wp-image-2059" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGS.jpg" alt="Mango IGS" width="1500" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGS.jpg 1500w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGS-300x267.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGS-768x683.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGS-1024x911.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2059" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @mango IGS via Instagram</p></div>
<p>In their IGTV, they created an Instagram video that feels like a movie, complete with an opening sequence. It&#8217;s fun, unique, and will surely pique the market&#8217;s interest.</p>
<div id="attachment_2060" style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2060" class="size-full wp-image-2060" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGTV.jpg" alt="Mango IGTV" width="2250" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGTV.jpg 2250w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGTV-300x178.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGTV-768x455.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mango-IGTV-1024x607.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2060" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @mango via Instagram</p></div>
<p>To top it all off, they also posted snippets of the teaser in their feed. One video earned 38K views in under 4 hours.</p>
<div id="attachment_2061" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2061" class="size-full wp-image-2061" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2064.jpg" alt="Mango Instagram video sample" width="750" height="865" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2064.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2064-260x300.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2061" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @mango via Instagram</p></div>
<h4>Don&#8217;t forget to utilize Instagram Stories!</h4>
<p>Aside from adding teaser videos to Stories, you can also post behind-the-scenes. A great example is from For Love and Lemons.</p>
<div id="attachment_2062" style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2062" class="size-full wp-image-2062" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/For-Love-and-Lemons-IGS.jpg" alt="For Love and Lemons IGS" width="2250" height="1334" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/For-Love-and-Lemons-IGS.jpg 2250w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/For-Love-and-Lemons-IGS-300x178.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/For-Love-and-Lemons-IGS-768x455.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/For-Love-and-Lemons-IGS-1024x607.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2062" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @forloveandlemons via Instagram</p></div>

<p>According to research conducted by Quinty, they discovered that IG videos receive up to <a href="https://www.quintly.com/blog/instagram-study" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">21% more engagement than images</a>.</p>
<p>What does this mean for brands, businesses, and influencers?</p>
<p>It means adding a killer video marketing to your strategies will help your brand stand out.</p>
<h2>How To Create Instagram Videos To Boost Engagement</h2>
<p>When making your Instagram video, be as creative as you want. However, make sure that it&#8217;ll capture your audience&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>Your video should spark curiosity within the first 3-5 seconds. It should encourage viewers to keep watching. So how do you create Instagram videos that are engaging?</p>
<h3>Determine Your Objectives</h3>
<p>First of all, you need to have a goal. Before you even brainstorm ideas, it&#8217;s crucial to figure out your objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to create hype for your new products?</li>
<li>Drive people to your websites?</li>
<li>Encourage viewers to make a purchase?</li>
<li>Teach your viewers how to do something</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing the purpose of your video will determine your next steps. For instance, it&#8217;ll help you decide how you&#8217;re going to shoot as well as the editing techniques you&#8217;ll need to use. Plus, it&#8217;ll help you come up with relevant hashtags.</p>
<h3>Keep Your Instagram Video Short</h3>
<p>An IG video can be 60 seconds long. But just because you can create a full minute video, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.</p>
<p>Remember, a viewer&#8217;s attention span on Instagram is very short. This means you need to capture their interest instantly or else, they&#8217;ll simply scroll past your content.</p>
<p>As a tip, you should use movement and visual stimulation. Take a look at this Instagram video by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oreo/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Oreo</a>. They created a clean yet colorful animation.</p>
<div id="attachment_2063" style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2063" class="size-full wp-image-2063" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oreo-Instagram-video-sample.jpg" alt="Oreo Instagram video sample" width="2250" height="1116" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oreo-Instagram-video-sample.jpg 2250w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oreo-Instagram-video-sample-300x149.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oreo-Instagram-video-sample-768x381.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Oreo-Instagram-video-sample-1024x508.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2063" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @oreo via Instagram</p></div>
<p>It showed the struggles of gift wrapping. Plus, they published it at the perfect time when the holidays were just around the corner.</p>
<p>Another way to capture your viewer&#8217;s attention is by adding compelling text. But we&#8217;ll talk more about that in the succeeding section.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Rely On Sound</h3>
<p>Instagram auto-play videos and they are muted by default. The viewer needs to tap the video to turn on the sound.</p>
<p>With that said, your video must be clear enough so your viewers will understand it even without sound. So how do you create attention-grabbing Instagram videos?</p>
<p>First of all, your videos must be of high quality. Create content that is as stunning as the images in your feed.</p>
<p>Remember, Instagram is a visual platform. Therefore, <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/post-on-instagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">aesthetic is crucial</a> so use visually-stunning images in your video.</p>
<p>Secondly, consider using text in your videos. In doing so, your viewers will be able to understand the message behind your video.</p>
<p>Take this example from WWF International. They used text to talk about a wildlife recovery story. In doing so, they provided value without even the need for sound!</p>
<div id="attachment_2064" style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2064" class="size-full wp-image-2064" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-with-text-overlay.jpg" alt="WWF instagram video with text overlay" width="2250" height="1113" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-with-text-overlay.jpg 2250w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-with-text-overlay-300x148.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-with-text-overlay-768x380.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/WWF-instagram-video-with-text-overlay-1024x507.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2064" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @wwf via Instagram</p></div>
<p>With that said, you shouldn&#8217;t also rely on adding text and subtitles. Your video must be clear and compelling enough to get your message across.</p>
<p>Create a coherent narrative through footage and proper editing. Take a look at this video content by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wework/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">We Work</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2065" style="width: 2256px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2065" class="size-full wp-image-2065" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/we-work-Instagram-video-sample.jpg" alt="we work Instagram video sample" width="2246" height="1070" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/we-work-Instagram-video-sample.jpg 2246w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/we-work-Instagram-video-sample-300x143.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/we-work-Instagram-video-sample-768x366.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/we-work-Instagram-video-sample-1024x488.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 2246px) 100vw, 2246px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2065" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @wework via Instagram</p></div>
<p>In this video, they were able to clearly convey what their company is about: providing shared workspaces.</p>
<h3>Incorporate Instagram Videos In Your Feed</h3>
<p>Your Instagram videos must have your brand identity and aesthetics. For example, if your feed looks clean and minimalist, then aim for something similar to your videos.</p>
<p>Additionally, consider making horizontal videos for your feed. Or use the same aspect ratio as your images.</p>
<p>Vertical videos are great for Instagram Stories and IGTV. However, it&#8217;ll look awkward in your feed. It&#8217;s better to shoot horizontally or in the same aspect ratio as images.</p>
<div id="attachment_2067" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2067" class="size-full wp-image-2067" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2094.jpg" alt="Burts Bees Instagram video in feed" width="750" height="1163" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2094.jpg 750w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2094-193x300.jpg 193w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_2094-660x1024.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2067" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @wwf via Instagram</p></div>
<p>Take this example from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/burtsbees/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Burts Bees</a>. They created a video with a 4:5 ratio. It&#8217;s big enough to take up most of the screen, grabbing the viewer&#8217;s attention. Additionally, it looked great as part of their feed as well.</p>
<div id="attachment_2066" style="width: 1178px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2066" class="size-full wp-image-2066" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Burts-Bees-Instagram-video.jpg" alt="Burts Bees Instagram video" width="1168" height="756" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Burts-Bees-Instagram-video.jpg 1168w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Burts-Bees-Instagram-video-300x194.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Burts-Bees-Instagram-video-768x497.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Burts-Bees-Instagram-video-1024x663.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2066" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: @burtsbees via Instagram</p></div>

<p>Animoto is definitely one of the best options if you want to create killer Instagram videos.</p>
<h3>Shakr</h3>
<p>Like the previous Instagram video creators we&#8217;ve listed, you also don&#8217;t need any experience to use Shakr.</p>
<p>This Instagram video creator boasts over 2,000 video designs! These are created by professional designers. Plus they also have available pre-licensed music. This means you can add background music without worrying about copyright infringement.</p>

<p>To make things easier, Shakr also has a drag-and-drop interface. All you have to do is upload your media files and add them to a video timeline.</p>
<div id="attachment_2075" style="width: 870px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075" class="size-full wp-image-2075" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/instagram-video-creator-create-instagram-videos-shakr-video-templates.png" alt="instagram-video-creator-create-instagram-videos-shakr-video-templates" width="860" height="539" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/instagram-video-creator-create-instagram-videos-shakr-video-templates.png 860w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/instagram-video-creator-create-instagram-videos-shakr-video-templates-300x188.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/instagram-video-creator-create-instagram-videos-shakr-video-templates-768x481.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075" class="wp-caption-text">Credit: Shakr</p></div>
<p>The downside? Users can only edit existing text, template media, and music. You have very few editing options in terms of clip length, fonts, and transitions.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People have wanted to edit Instagram photos as long as Instagram has been around. We weren’t all slapping X-Pro II onto our lattes in 2012 for nothing. Editing Instagram photos is such a key part of the app that it’s synonymous with the entire Instagram experience. Photo editors have literally come out because of Instagram trends. If you’ve decided to move on from Instagram filters and give editing your photos another shot, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s take a look at how to get started editing your Instagram photos today!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decide on A Style </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a signature style you can use on all your Instagram photos is a good idea. Creating a brand often has to do with way more than promotion. You also need to think about the colors you use and the vibe you want your photos to give off. Feel free to play around with this; nobody discovered their style in one day. But think about what you like &#8211; are you into chic, black and white vibes, or do you gravitate more towards bright, eye-catching colors?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ariana Grande edits her Instagram photos with plenty of ‘90s throwback flair. When you think Ari, you know automatically it’s one of her photos. Somebody’s been on Hujicam!</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1780 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.56.00-AM-1024x677.jpg" alt="A screenshot showing Ariana Grande's 90s look on her Instagram" width="1024" height="677" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.56.00-AM-1024x677.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.56.00-AM-300x198.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.56.00-AM-768x508.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.56.00-AM.jpg 1902w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Taylor Swift, by contrast, loves to play with colors and clean lines. It&#8217;s like looking at a candy store and fits in perfectly with Taylor&#8217;s brand. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1781 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.57.35-AM-1024x685.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift's Instagram feed showing the style of her photos" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.57.35-AM-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.57.35-AM-300x201.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.57.35-AM-768x514.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.57.35-AM.jpg 1904w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Both celebrities&#8217; personalities are on display on their Instagram feeds. Their photos have a unique style and color composition to them that makes them instantly identifiable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you even take your Instagram photos, take a moment to think about your composition and lighting too. A lot of work can be done to make a photo look good before you ever need to edit it. Editing should enhance what’s already evident in a photo &#8211; not save it. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find An App You Love to Edit Your Instagram Photos</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are so many apps available to edit Instagram photos nowadays that editing has become extremely commonplace. In fact, it may be harder to find an unedited photo on Instagram than an edited one! A great trick for editing Instagram photos is just to find an app that you love and become so familiar with it that you know exactly how to create the look you want. Your unique style will show through if you’re doing it for you! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Instagram photo editors offer the use of <a href="https://later.com/blog/how-to-use-lightroom-presets/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">preset filters or even the ability to save your own presets</a>. But before you go straight to someone else’s style, we recommend playing around with the app really extensively. Getting familiar with the tools you’re using will help you develop a unique style, and you may even discover features that you didn’t know about before and want to make ample use of.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram Apps To Edit Your Photos</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few tried and true apps that you can always turn to if you don’t know where to start. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">FOR THE VINTAGE LOOK: LOMOGRAPH AND HUJICAM</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re into a 90s aesthetic, there are quite a few apps you can use to edit Instagram photos. The first and most famous is Hujicam. Although Huji has great filters, it’s a little inconvenient because it mimics the experience of a disposable camera, so you can’t apply filters to your photos after you’ve taken them. Try Lomograph instead, which lets you apply filters after the fact. Throwback selfies here we come.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAPSEED</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snapseed is one of the original photo editors that people began to use outside of Instagram. It’s super straightforward and is a great option for anybody who doesn’t have a background in photo editing but still wants to create amazing photos. Snapseed offers all the basic editing services that Instagram does, but allows you to boost some other aspects to get a perfect Instagram look.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LIGHTROOM</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many photo professionals use Lightroom, and it’s clear why. Lightroom was specifically developed with photos in mind as a bit of an easier version of Photoshop, and their free app is pretty amazing. Although it’s not quite as simple to use as Snapseed, it doesn’t take too much time to adapt to. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1783 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.15.08-PM-1024x746.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Lightroom's Capture Play post" width="1024" height="746" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.15.08-PM-1024x746.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.15.08-PM-300x219.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.15.08-PM-768x559.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.15.08-PM.jpg 1628w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHOTOSHOP</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photoshop is the OG photo editor for good reason! It simply has many capabilities that other apps don’t. This one definitely has the biggest learning curve, though &#8211; we won’t blame you if you stick to something else. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Looks Good On Instagram?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no real formula for what performs well on Instagram. The best thing you can do is showcase your own personal touch. But if you’re looking for some blanket guiding rules, you can see from the Instagram explore page that the kinds of posts that perform the best are usually brightly colored and eye-catching. The composition is just as important as the colors, too. People tend to like symmetrical, interesting angles and plenty of clarity in photos. We want to see what we&#8217;re looking at! </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t Be Afraid to Change It Up</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t let it pressure you, though. Feel free to experiment and change up your style! Instagrams evolve just as people do, and you may not like the same thing this year you did last year. That’s okay! While it’s probably not a great idea for your brand to go from ultra-bright, fun looks straight to black and white, don’t get locked down on just one idea of how something should be. When you edit Instagram photos, let it show off your personality. And your personality won’t always stay the same. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let Your Photos Show Off Your Personality </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your photos are a representation of you. Don’t force yourself into editing your photos a certain way because a celebrity you liked did it, or because you think it’s more likely to be noticed that way. Forcing yourself to somebody else’s guidelines or style is a great way to make sure you hate your photos by the time you’re finished. If you like bright, eye-catching colors, go for it! Or if you want to keep all your photos black and white, that&#8217;s fine too. Even if you don&#8217;t want to edit your photos at all but just continue slapping X-Pro II onto your latte pictures &#8211; your Instagram, your choice. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1784 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.22.02-PM-1024x709.jpg" alt="A lomograph screenshot" width="1024" height="709" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.22.02-PM-1024x709.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.22.02-PM-300x208.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.22.02-PM-768x531.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.22.02-PM.jpg 1734w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s No Right Way to Edit Instagram Photos</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Editing your Instagram photos is a unique challenge. Building a brand does require a certain amount of adherence to aesthetic, and for an amateur photo editor, it can be overwhelming. But once you decide on a style &#8211; and allow yourself to evolve within that style &#8211; editing your photos becomes easier and easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the time to play around with your style before posting. Explore apps and really get to know one you like. But don’t forget that the work done before posting a photo is often just as crucial as the work done in editing! Think about colors, framing, and composition before you take your photos. That way when it&#8217;s time to edit them, you&#8217;ve already got a clear goal in mind of what you want the end product to look like. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t sweat when editing Instagram photos. It’s just a matter of exploring until you find what works for you.</span></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have been searching for the ultimate Instagram marketing tool, chances are you have heard about Combin. You&#8217;re probably wondering if this tool is worth your time. After playing around with the tool for a few days, I decided to write this Combin review to share my experience with you.</p>
<h2>Is Combin a Bot?</h2>
<p>Look, if you&#8217;re planning to use this tool to automatically grow your Instagram account, there&#8217;s something that you need to know. Combin is not an Instagram bot.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t automate activity on your profile. It won&#8217;t auto follow users, like content, or leave comments. The tool is more for audience management.</p>
<p>In other words, a dashboard with reports, charts, and other analytical marketing tools to build an extremely targeted following.</p>
<p>In other words, it doesn&#8217;t perform any actions for you. But it does give you the option to manually interact with accounts.</p>
<p>However, I noticed Combin is planning to launch auto-tasks soon. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s unclear when the changes will be added. We will keep a close eye on Combin and update this review whenever they add new features.</p>
<h3>Combin Products</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1471 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-1024x295.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="295" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-1024x295.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-300x86.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts-768x221.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinproducts.jpg 1787w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>First things first, Combin has two products: Growth and Scheduler. The Growth is focused on audience management while Scheduler is simply a tool for uploading and schedule posts and Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>Before you get too excited, unfortunately Scheduler hasn&#8217;t been released yet. It&#8217;s marked as &#8220;Coming Soon&#8221; which is a shame because it seems like quite a useful product.</p>
<h3>Installation Required</h3>
<p>Another important thing you need to know about this tool is you have to download it and run it on your computer. Luckily, there are versions for all major operating systems, such as Windows, IOS, and even Ubuntu. At the moment, there is no browser based version.</p>
<p>To access the program, you have to download and install it. Thankfully, the system requirements are very low, the only requirement is 4GB of RAM and 2 GB of disk space. It doesn&#8217;t consume a lot of resources, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re probably wondering if you need to use a VPS to run this program 24/7. Since the tool doesn&#8217;t automate activity (it&#8217;s not a bot) you don&#8217;t need to have it open and running all the time. In other words, there&#8217;s no reason to buy a VPS for this tool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you have more than one Instagram account, Combin does recommend use proxies from their recommended list. The point is to get a dedicated proxy so your login location doesn&#8217;t keep switching every time, a clear sign you&#8217;re using a bot.</p>
<h3>Prices &amp; Fees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Starter &#8211; Free</li>
<li>Personal &#8211; $10/month</li>
<li>Business &#8211;  $30/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: These prices are for Combin Growth because Combin Scheduler hasn&#8217;t been released yet.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1472 size-large" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-1024x192.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="192" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-1024x192.jpg 1024w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-300x56.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices-768x144.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinprices.jpg 1705w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the prices are reasonable. I like how they include a free account for you to play around with.</p>
<p>The Starter account does have some limits, but it should give you an idea of how the tool works. It&#8217;s also nice to know there are no time limits or hidden fees &#8211; it&#8217;s free &#8211; forever.</p>
<p>Eventually, Personal and Business will include auto-tasks, although we&#8217;re not sure when those features will arrive. Until then, the main difference between the subscription plans are the numbers of accounts you can connect.</p>
<p>With Starter and Personal, you can only connect<strong> one Instagram account</strong>. With Business, you can connect up to 5 for free, with the option to buy slots for 10 more.</p>
<p>Now that we got the basics out of the way, I&#8217;ll show you what this tool can do for you.</p>
<h2>Getting Started with Combin</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1473 size-full" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinlogin.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="557" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinlogin.jpg 511w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/combinlogin-275x300.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 511px) 100vw, 511px" /></p>
<p>Think of Combin more like an Instagram user search tool. It has a lot of filters you can use to find very specific users on Instagram.</p>
<p>After connecting Combin to your Instagram account, the next step is to create a New Search. You can either search for posts or users.</p>
<h3>Searching for Posts</h3>
<p>Searching for posts is useful because you can not only like those posts but also interact with the owners of the pictures.</p>
<p>With Combin, you can search for posts by location or hashtag or both together. This makes it easy for you to send out &#8220;Pings&#8221; to other people in your industry.</p>
<h3>Searching for Users</h3>
<p>Now this feature is probably the most useful. It&#8217;s the main feature you&#8217;ll be using to build your audience. What this is mainly designed for is to build a similar audience as your competition.</p>
<p>To start you&#8217;ll need the username of a profile you want to compete with.</p>
<p>Select the &#8220;Search By&#8221; option from the drop down menu:</p>
<ol>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>Followings</li>
<li>Commenters</li>
<li>Likers</li>
<li>Bio</li>
<li>Users List</li>
</ol>
<p>And now you fill in the relevant results. For example, if you select the &#8220;Followers&#8221; option, the tool will find all the followers of the specific user you added earlier. Likewise, the &#8220;Commenters&#8221; option will show all the people who left comments, and so on.</p>
<p>You can also use the Advanced Filter and Analysis to narrow down the users even further. For instance, hide inefficient accounts, filter by gender, filter by language, filter by last activity, and what not.</p>
<p>If you use these filters correctly, it should be easy to build a following of active users.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Bio filter allows you to search for users that contain a specific keyword in their bio description.</p>
<h3>Sliders</h3>
<p>With every search, there&#8217;s a likes and comment slider, even for hashtag searches. The purpose of these sliders is to set a range of activity. It&#8217;s useful for finding active users that are using the same hashtag you&#8217;re searching for. In other words, a great way to guarantee you only find active users.</p>
<h3>Manage Your Followers</h3>
<p>Once cool feature of this app is you can easily manage your own followers. You can see who is not following you back and mass follow and un-follow users with a few clicks.</p>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s best not to un-follow too many users at one time. Limit the amount of follows and un-follows to a handful, at least at first.</p>
<h3>Export a List</h3>
<p>Another great feature is the ability to export a list of Instagram users. You can make a list for almost every type of user.</p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users Following</li>
<li>Followers</li>
<li>Unfollowed</li>
<li>Safe List</li>
<li>Black List</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it very easy to organize users or import lists into other projects. Great for data geeks!</p>
<h2>Combin Pros</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at the pros.</p>
<h3>Safe 👍</h3>
<p>When it comes to Instagram tools, the first question people ask is, &#8220;Is It a Safe?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since Combin does not automate any activity on your profile, it&#8217;s very safe. Think of it more like a Instagram browser and management tool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the option to interact with users manually. And if you interact with too many users at a time, then Instagram might temporarily lock your account.</p>
<p>On top of that, you can add proxies for an extra layer of security. Overall, I feel like Combin is perfectly safe, and there&#8217;s no need to worry about being banned.</p>
<h3>Budget-Friendly 👍</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, Combin is a very cheap Instagram management tool. The fact that they have a free-forever starter account is great too. The paid version only costs $10 a month. Granted, it won&#8217;t automatically build your audience for you, but it&#8217;s a decent tool for searching and managing users.</p>
<h3>Schedule Posts with Growth 👍</h3>
<p>Growth is a separate product from Combin that can be used to upload and schedule posts. Personally, I really like this tool. Not only can you schedule posts, but also add all the relevant details, such as descriptions, hashtags, and location.</p>
<p>You can also schedule posts down to the minute and view all your scheduled posts in a nice grid calendar layout. Definitely worth looking into.</p>
<p>P.S. Take a look at <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/the-top-5-instagram-schedulers/" data-wpel-link="internal">our recommended Instagram schedulers! </a></p>
<h3>Easily Interact with Users and Posts 👍</h3>
<p>One thing I really liked about this tool is you can easily interact with users and posts you find. In the search results you&#8217;ll see quick-action buttons for the actions. You can leave comments, like the post, and even direct message users.</p>
<p>The good news is you can also easily manage your own content, for instance, reply to comments on your posts. I thought this was really cool because you can search for hashtags using the activity sliders and then just like all the posts on there, sending out pings to lots of users.</p>
<h2>Combin Cons</h2>
<p>And now for the downsides.</p>
<h3>No Auto Tasks (Coming Soon!) 👎</h3>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, currently Combin does not include auto tasks. I see how this might be a deal breaker for people looking to quickly grow their accounts. It seems like this service has been in the planning stages for quite some time now.</p>
<h3>Has to Run on Your Computer 👎</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Combin is not browser based. You have to download and install it. It can be a little bothersome to open the program and login every time you want to use it.</p>
<h3>Case by Case Refund Policy 👎</h3>
<p>Most software companies will grant you a full refund with no questions asked. With Combin, they&#8217;ll only refund your order if your situation meets their requirements for a refund.</p>
<p>They only grant refunds for specific cases. For more details on that, read <a href="https://www.combin.com/refund-policy/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">their official refund policy</a>. The good news is you cancel at any time, and it&#8217;s very cheap, so the risks are low.</p>
<h3>Prone to Errors 👎</h3>
<p>While researching Combin, I kept coming across posts from users struggling with various errors. It seems like Combin is prone to some unexplained errors. One of these is &#8220;Waiting for Instagram Callback&#8221; while the app straight up crashes for some users. It also seems a bit unstable, some days it works, other days not at all.</p>
<h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>Our overall combin review: 👎</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering if Combin is a tool we recommend. Although we don&#8217;t have any hard feelings towards this tool, it&#8217;s not something we wholeheartedly recommend. Nevertheless, I feel like it&#8217;s a decent tool and definitely can be used to grow a highly targeted audience.</p>
<p>Based on the cons mentioned earlier, I don&#8217;t think Combin is worth it for long term use. The main issue for me is the unreliable performance. I don&#8217;t want to have to sit around all day waiting for the callback error to disappear.</p>
<p>In addition to the errors, some times the features won&#8217;t work at all. For example, when you create a new search, no results show. It seems like recently the tool hasn&#8217;t been working well at all.</p>
<h2>Combin Alternatives</h2>
<p>Looking for a Combin alternative? I&#8217;v got you covered.</p>
<p>Below I&#8217;ll briefly introduce two Instagram automation tools from our list of <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">recommended Instagram managers.</a></p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a> &#8211; Free Trial 🌟 (No CC Required)</h3>
<p>The way Upleap works is pretty cool. They assign a real person to your Instagram account to create activity on your behalf. It&#8217;s like hiring your own personal social media marketer but at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Your manager will leave comments, like posts, and anything else you request of them. The best part is you can sign up for the free trial without entering any credit card information.</p>
<p>Upleap isn&#8217;t really a bot, so it&#8217;s much safer than most automation tools.</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji</a> &#8211; Free Trial 🌟 (No CC Required)</h3>
<p>For those of you on a budget, Kenji is worth a look. Kenji uses machine learning AI technology to mimic human behavior on your account.</p>
<p>What it does is basically copy the way that you use your Instagram account and then automate that activity over and over. It&#8217;s very budget-friendly. And you can also sign-up without a credit card.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind Kenji is an automation Instagram bot.</p>
<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>Remember, it&#8217;s important to remember Instagram is always on the lookout for people using bots.</p>
<p>Although they probably won&#8217;t straight-up ban you, they will lock you out of your account, and require other confirmation, which can be incredibly bothersome. So, when it comes to using any Instagram tool, make sure to take necessary precautions!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Combin review. Hopefully now you know if the tool is worth your time or not. If you liked the post, don&#8217;t forget to share it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the advent of its platform, Instagram has primarily been a mobile app. Its camera functions and user-friendliness make for better use on a smartphone; but for those of us who prefer a screen and keyboard, can Instagram be used for PC?</p>
<p>Short answer: Yes. Though doing so does come with a few tricks, and third-party apps if necessary. Some of these tools may come free of charge; while others may cost a tiny price.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive into some of the best, tried-and-tested methods of using Instagram straight from your desktop.</p>
<h2>Using The Instagram Website From Your Computer</h2>
<p>The easiest way of accessing Instagram for PC users is to visit Instagram&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Simply type &#8220;Instagram.com&#8221; into your browser and enter your login details. If don&#8217;t already have an account, you can also easily sign up for one.</p>
<div id="attachment_1531" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1531" class="size-full wp-image-1531" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-for-pc-website.png" alt="Use Instagram for PC - website version" width="1000" height="789" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-for-pc-website.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-for-pc-website-300x237.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-for-pc-website-768x606.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1531" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Instagram.</p></div>
<p>The interface of the Instagram&#8217;s desktop site is largely similar to that of the mobile app. The first page you see is your home feed, complete with your real-time lineup of recent Story updates from those you follow.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1527" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-interface.png" alt="Instagram for PC - Inspect Browser" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-interface.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-interface-300x200.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-interface-768x511.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Unlike the mobile app, your navigation panel is located at the upper end of your screen. The same page icons are available &#8211; your notifications, the Explore page, and your profile (though the Explore icon has changed to the image of compass, rather than a magnifying glass). At the center of your panel is a search field for looking up other users or hashtags.</p>
<p>You can browse through your home feed and Explore page as normal, albeit with a less stylish display. You can also like, comment, and share others&#8217; posts.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1529 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop-explore-page.png" alt="Use Instagram from computer - Explore page" width="1000" height="851" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop-explore-page.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop-explore-page-300x255.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop-explore-page-768x654.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>However, Instagram&#8217;s desktop features end here. The option of uploading photos or Story content straight from your PC is, sadly, non-existent.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s where browser tricks and third-party platforms come into play.</p>
<h2>Why Use Instagram From Your Desktop?</h2>
<p>You may be wondering: what&#8217;s the point of using Instagram from your computer, anyway?</p>
<p>While not necessarily an appealing option for everyone, those who take their &#8216;gramming seriously may find that a desktop version boosts efficiency and convenience when managing their profiles.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1528 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop.jpg" alt="Use Instagram from desktop" width="1000" height="550" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop-300x165.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-from-desktop-768x422.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Not only is it easier to type up long captions, messages, or comments on a keyboard; there&#8217;s also the benefit of taking pictures from a higher-quality camera, transferring these onto your desktop, and uploading them straight onto the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can edit your photos through more professional desktop programs, and share the final products directly onto your profile.</p>
<h2>Instagram for PC &#8211; Using Third-Party Schedulers</h2>
<p>Before exploring more advanced tools that emulate Instagram&#8217;s mobile interface directly on your PC, let&#8217;s first take a look at scheduling apps.</p>
<p>These platforms let you prepare your Instagram content days, weeks, and even <em>months </em>in advance &#8211; image edits, captions, and all. They then allow you to schedule them as necessary, and publish the content on your behalf according to your set times.</p>
<p>While you aren&#8217;t technically using the Instagram <em>platform </em>straight from your desktop, they&#8217;re handy loopholes for publishing high-quality videos and photos right from your computer.</p>
<h3>Later</h3>
<p>Later is a well-proven beast of a marketing platform, used and beloved by Instagrammers everywhere.</p>
<p>Arguably the service&#8217;s most notable feature, its visual calendar enables users to plan out and preview their Instagram feed. Using their drag-and-drop functions, individuals can easily place content into their desired time slots, instantly scheduling them for future posting.</p>
<div id="attachment_175" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175" class="size-full wp-image-175" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview.png" alt="Visual planning with Later" width="1000" height="476" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview-300x143.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-visual-preview-768x366.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-175" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>
<p>Not only does this feature provide daily, weekly, and monthly calendar previews, you also have the option of viewing how your grid will ultimately look in-app.</p>
<p>Users additionally have a media library for organizing all their potential content, with labelling options for ease of search. For further efficiency, they can also choose to bulk schedule posts into pre-set weekly time slots.</p>
<div id="attachment_174" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174" class="size-full wp-image-174" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling.png" alt="Instagram post scheduling with Later" width="1000" height="437" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling-300x131.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-later-scheduling-768x336.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-174" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Later.</p></div>
<p>Later offers some of the best (and well-trusted) third-party tools for managing one&#8217;s Instagram content. Their auto-publishing rids of that extra effort in remembering to manually post at optimum engagement times &#8211; though a <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-business-profile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">business profile</a> is required to access this feature.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 1.84615; margin-top: 1.71429rem; margin-bottom: 1.71429rem; font-size: 1.14286rem;">Hootsuite</h3>
<p>Like Later, Hootsuite also prides in being one of the leading third-party schedulers for Instagram.</p>
<p>Its interface, however, takes on a different look. Hootsuite offers its users with a dashboard as their main page displaying all their connected social media profiles and scheduled streams of content. (Other than Instagram, Hootsuite also lets you hook up your Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest accounts).</p>
<div id="attachment_167" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167" class="size-full wp-image-167" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-dashboard.png" alt="Instagram post scheduler - Hootsuite dashboard" width="1000" height="641" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-dashboard.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-dashboard-300x192.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-dashboard-768x492.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-167" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Hootsuite.</p></div>
<p>However, scheduled and published content can still viewed through a &#8220;calendar&#8221; display through Hootsuite&#8217;s &#8220;Planner&#8221; tool. The interface is similar to that of Later&#8217;s, displaying your weekly scheduled content and their designated time slots.</p>
<div id="attachment_1519" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1519" class="size-full wp-image-1519" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hootsuite-planner-tool.png" alt="Use Instagram on PC - Hootsuite Planner" width="1000" height="402" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hootsuite-planner-tool.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hootsuite-planner-tool-300x121.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hootsuite-planner-tool-768x309.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1519" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Hootsuite.</p></div>
<p>When adding new content to this calendar, users get to preview the final look of their Instagram post, captions and all. Unfortunately, a full preview of your overall grid is not available with this platform.</p>
<div id="attachment_168" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168" class="size-full wp-image-168" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-edit-new-post.png" alt="How to schedule Instagram posts - Hootsuite" width="1000" height="560" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-edit-new-post.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-edit-new-post-300x168.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/how-to-schedule-posts-on-instagram-scheduler-hootsuite-edit-new-post-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-168" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Hootsuite.</p></div>
<p>On top of scheduling options, Hootsuite users can also track their Instagram performance through built-in analytical tools and visual reports.</p>
<h3>ViralTag</h3>
<p>Last but not least, we&#8217;ve got ViralTag.</p>
<p>Viraltag offers yet another visual marketing calendar, allowing users to schedule content for a variety of social media platforms. Just like Later, ViralTag provides a full preview of your Instagram grid, ensuring your posts tie together cohesively.</p>
<div id="attachment_1536" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1536" class="size-full wp-image-1536" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-instagram-tool-use-instagram-for-pc.png" alt="Viraltag - Instagram scheduler" width="1000" height="483" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-instagram-tool-use-instagram-for-pc.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-instagram-tool-use-instagram-for-pc-300x145.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-instagram-tool-use-instagram-for-pc-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1536" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Viraltag.</p></div>
<p>The service&#8217;s stand-out feature is its integration with the photo-editing tool, Canva. ViralTag already offers users with built-in editing options, though those looking for extra pizzazz on their photos can take advantage of Canva&#8217;s generous tools and customization features. As a result, you&#8217;re able to create high-quality, professionally-edited photos &#8211; ready for scheduling.</p>
<div id="attachment_1535" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1535" class="size-full wp-image-1535" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-canva-feature.png" alt="Vivaldi - Canva feature" width="1000" height="471" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-canva-feature.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-canva-feature-300x141.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-canva-feature-768x362.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1535" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Vivaldi.</p></div>
<p>The platform also provides a hashtag tracker, helping you scout for any Instagram content related to your brand. This is particularly useful in curating any potential user-generated content (UGC).</p>
<div id="attachment_1537" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1537" class="size-full wp-image-1537" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-ugc-instagram-from-desktop.png" alt="Viraltag - Instagram UGC" width="1000" height="614" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-ugc-instagram-from-desktop.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-ugc-instagram-from-desktop-300x184.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/viraltag-ugc-instagram-from-desktop-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1537" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Viraltag.</p></div>
<p>Sadly, its biggest pitfall is the lack of an auto-publishing feature. Users instead receive a push notification from ViralTag; this then prompts them to swipe through to manually post their content on Instagram.</p>
<h2>Instagram for PC &#8211; Using the App Straight From Your Desktop</h2>
<p>Instagram schedulers may be all good and well, but perhaps you&#8217;re looking to use the <em>entire </em>Instagram app straight from your PC.</p>
<p>Not to worry &#8211; these unique apps should get the job done easily.</p>
<h3>Use Instagram From Your Computer &#8211; Bluestacks App Player</h3>
<p>For those who wish to use the exact same Instagram interface on PC, look no further than Bluestacks.</p>
<p>This is a popularly-used tool for emulating Android applications on desktop.  To get started, you&#8217;ll first need to download the Bluestacks software (for free!).</p>
<div id="attachment_1522" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1522" class="size-full wp-image-1522" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player.png" alt="Use Instagram for PC - Bluestacks App Player" width="1000" height="395" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player-300x119.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player-768x303.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1522" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Bluestacks App Player.</p></div>
<p>Once you launch the app, search for &#8220;Instagram&#8221; in the main search field. This will pull up the Instagram app for you to install.</p>
<div id="attachment_1520" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1520" class="size-full wp-image-1520" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-instagram-from-desktop-bluestacks-app-player-Z3RD-youtube.png" alt="Bluestacks App Player - Install Instagram" width="1000" height="513" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-instagram-from-desktop-bluestacks-app-player-Z3RD-youtube.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-instagram-from-desktop-bluestacks-app-player-Z3RD-youtube-300x154.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-instagram-from-desktop-bluestacks-app-player-Z3RD-youtube-768x394.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1520" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Z3RD (Youtube channel).</p></div>
<p>Upon installing Instagram on Bluestacks, you&#8217;re now ready to use it on your desktop. Double-click on its icon in your section of installed apps.</p>
<p>Bluestacks will then display Instagram as it appears on a smartphone screen. You can then interact with it as you wish; all functions available on the mobile app should work the exact same way on screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_1515" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1515" class="size-full wp-image-1515" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluestacks-app-player-instagram-home-feed-Z3RD-youtube.png" alt="Bluestacks App Player - Instagram home feed" width="1000" height="504" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluestacks-app-player-instagram-home-feed-Z3RD-youtube.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluestacks-app-player-instagram-home-feed-Z3RD-youtube-300x151.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bluestacks-app-player-instagram-home-feed-Z3RD-youtube-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1515" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Z3RD (Youtube channel).</p></div>
<p>To upload photos, you must first have your content saved in to Bluestacks&#8217; media manager.</p>
<div id="attachment_1523" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1523" class="size-full wp-image-1523" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player-media-manager.png" alt="Bluestacks App Player - media manager" width="1000" height="514" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player-media-manager.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player-media-manager-300x154.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-bluestacks-app-player-media-manager-768x395.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1523" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Z3RD (Youtube channel).</p></div>
<p>This media will then appear in your &#8220;camera roll&#8221; when uploading a new photo from your desktop.</p>

<p>Add your filters, captions, and hashtags as normal &#8211; and post your final product directly to your Instagram feed!</p>

<h3>Use Instagram From Your Computer &#8211; Vivaldi</h3>
<p>Another tool that emulates the Instagram app for PC is Vivaldi.</p>
<p>Rather than some fancy software or desktop application, Vivaldi is simply a freeware, cross-platform web browser. It offers users with plenty of customization features, including color schemes and tab positioning. You can group your favorite tabs into saved window sessions, and write in-browser notes for future use or reference.</p>
<div id="attachment_1533" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1533" class="size-full wp-image-1533" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-vivaldi.png" alt="Use Instagram from desktop - Vivaldi" width="1000" height="446" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-vivaldi.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-vivaldi-300x134.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-vivaldi-768x343.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1533" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Vivaldi.</p></div>
<p>However, its leading feature is the option to create &#8220;web panels&#8221;; giving users the ability to have multiple websites open side-by-side within the same browser window. (Multi-taskers, rejoice!) This is where using your Instagram on desktop comes in.</p>
<div id="attachment_1538" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1538" class="size-full wp-image-1538" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-features.png" alt="VIvaldi features" width="1000" height="563" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-features.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-features-300x169.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-features-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1538" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Vivaldi.</p></div>
<p>To manage your Instagram profile on your PC, simply open up Instagram as a web panel. Its mobile version will instantly display as the default view, allowing you to interact with its interface as you would on a smartphone. This includes posting and editing your content right from your desktop! It&#8217;s that easy &#8211; though sadly, direct messaging features are unavailable.</p>
<div id="attachment_1539" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1539" class="size-full wp-image-1539" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-use-instagram-from-computer.png" alt="Vivaldi - use Instagram from computer" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-use-instagram-from-computer.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-use-instagram-from-computer-300x169.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/vivaldi-use-instagram-from-computer-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1539" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Vivaldi.</p></div>
<h3>Use Instagram From Your Computer &#8211; Flume Pro</h3>
<p>Mac users can marvel at both the beautiful interface and practical functions of Flume &#8211; one of Apple&#8217;s leading platforms for using Instagram on your desktop.</p>
<p>Flume enables Instagrammers to perform most every function available on their smartphone, including uploading and editing new content for those who purchase its Pro version.</p>
<div id="attachment_1532" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1532" class="size-full wp-image-1532" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-computer-flumepro.png" alt="Use Instagram from computer - Flume" width="1000" height="635" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-computer-flumepro.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-computer-flumepro-300x191.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-computer-flumepro-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1532" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Flume.</p></div>
<p>The main display is designed similarly to that of a phone screen: slim and vertical. Both photos and videos can be uploaded directly from your Mac; and the app offers a unique editing studio that houses all of Instagram&#8217;s built-in filters and photo adjustments.</p>
<div id="attachment_1512" style="width: 371px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1512" class="size-full wp-image-1512" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-interface.png" alt="FlumePro interface" width="361" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-interface.png 361w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-interface-135x300.png 135w" sizes="(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1512" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Flume.</p></div>
<p>This same suite allows you to write in your caption, along with hashtags, geotags, and user tags. (The counters below are a nice touch, indicating whether you&#8217;ve reached your tag or character limit.)</p>
<div id="attachment_1513" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1513" class="size-full wp-image-1513" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-photo-editor.png" alt="FlumePro photo editor" width="1000" height="581" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-photo-editor.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-photo-editor-300x174.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anysoftwaretools-flumepro-photo-editor-768x446.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1513" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Flume.</p></div>
<p>When you&#8217;re done, click the &#8220;Post&#8221; button below &#8211; and it&#8217;s sent straight to your Instagram feed!</p>
<p>Flume additionally provides a slick view of your Instagram home feed, explore page, and the option to access your direct messages. All interaction functions (comments, <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-instagram-likes-the-best-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">likes</a>, shares) are available and straightforward to use.</p>
<div id="attachment_1521" style="width: 496px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1521" class="size-full wp-image-1521" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-flumepro-interface.jpg" alt="Flume Pro - Instagram interface" width="486" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-flumepro-interface.jpg 486w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-flumepro-interface-182x300.jpg 182w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1521" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Flume.</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the absence of an <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/how-to-go-live-on-instagram-guide-to-instagram-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Instagram Live</a> or Stories function, Flume offers enough features (some of which go beyond the mobile version) to make it well worth its $10, one-time fee.</p>
<h3>Use Instagram From Your Computer &#8211; Deskgram Pro</h3>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ve got Deskgram Pro.</p>
<p>As its name labels it, Deskgram recreates a &#8220;desktop version&#8221; of Instagram for both Mac and PC users. The platform may lack a few functions provided by the mobile app, though it does the basic job well.</p>
<p>Photos can be uploaded straight from your computer files, with the same filter options as found on the mobile versions. Users are able to craft and publish complete posts &#8211; captions, hashtags, mention tags, and all.</p>
<div id="attachment_1517" style="width: 502px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1517" class="size-full wp-image-1517" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/deskgrampro-use-instagram-from-computer.png" alt="Use Instagram from computer - Deskgram" width="492" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/deskgrampro-use-instagram-from-computer.png 492w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/deskgrampro-use-instagram-from-computer-185x300.png 185w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1517" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Deskgram.</p></div>
<p>You can also choose to upload videos, with the options to trim and crop your file as necessary.</p>
<div id="attachment_1518" style="width: 611px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1518" class="size-full wp-image-1518" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/deskgrampro-use-instagram-from-computer-videos.jpg" alt="Deskgram Pro - Editing videos" width="601" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/deskgrampro-use-instagram-from-computer-videos.jpg 601w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/deskgrampro-use-instagram-from-computer-videos-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1518" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Deskgram.</p></div>
<p>The interface is largely similar to that of Instagram mobile. The same search functions are provided, allowing you to look up your favorite accounts and hashtags.</p>
<div id="attachment_1530" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1530" class="size-full wp-image-1530" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/search-instagram-users-and-tags-deskgrampro.png" alt="Deskgram - Search users and tags" width="1000" height="521" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/search-instagram-users-and-tags-deskgrampro.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/search-instagram-users-and-tags-deskgrampro-300x156.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/search-instagram-users-and-tags-deskgrampro-768x400.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1530" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of Deskgram.</p></div>
<p>A free version of this tool is available for all users, though offers exclusively interactive functions such as liking, commenting, seaching, and browsing through people&#8217;s feeds. To upload content right from your PC, a &#8220;Pro&#8221; subscription is required for $2.99 a month.</p>
<p>This version allows unlimited video and image uploads, along with basic social functions.</p>
<p>Sadly, Deskgram lacks the ability to view stories, send direct messages, and log in via Facebook.</p>
<h3>Use Instagram From Your Computer With This Browser Trick</h3>
<p>If all else fails, you can always opt for this method of using Instagram on your desktop &#8211; no apps or extra software required.</p>
<h4>For Google Chrome Users</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re using the Google Chrome browser on either a Mac or PC, your instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>Step1: Open Instagram.com in a new tab and enter your login credentials.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1534" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-on-desktop-website.jpg" alt="Instagram desktop website" width="1000" height="693" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-on-desktop-website.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-on-desktop-website-300x208.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-on-desktop-website-768x532.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Step 2: Right-click on your screen, and select &#8220;Inspect&#8221;.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1545" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser.jpg" alt="Use Instagram from desktop - Inspect browser" width="1000" height="687" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser.jpg 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser-300x206.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Step 3: A side panel will appear displaying the page elements. At the top left-hand corner of this window is an icon allowing to toggle between desktop and mobile view.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1524" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser.png" alt="Instagram for PC - Inspect Browser" width="1000" height="568" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser-300x170.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser-768x436.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Step 4: In your main browser window, select &#8220;Responsive&#8221; to open a drop-down menu. This will display all the available device previews; select one according to your preference.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1526" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser-responsive-options.png" alt="Instagram for PC - Inspect Browser" width="1000" height="620" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser-responsive-options.png 1000w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser-responsive-options-300x186.png 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagram-for-pc-inspect-browser-responsive-options-768x476.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p>Step 5: At this stage, you may be missing the navigation panel available on mobile devices. Simply refresh your tab, and this should prompt the section to appear.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1546 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser-navigation-panel.jpg" alt="Inspect browser - Generate Instagram navigation panel" width="498" height="800" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser-navigation-panel.jpg 498w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-inspect-browser-navigation-panel-187x300.jpg 187w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /></p>
<p>And you&#8217;re done! Your navigation options work just as they do on mobile &#8211; including the ability to upload photos straight from your computer files.</p>
<h3>For Safari Users</h3>
<p>Mac users on Safari&#8217;s browser have slightly different steps to achieve this, though doing so is just as simple.</p>
<p>Step 1: Select the Safari menu at the top left-hand corner of the browser. Click on &#8220;Preferences&#8221;.</p>
<div id="attachment_1541" style="width: 238px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1541" class="size-full wp-image-1541" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-preferences.jpg" alt="Use Instagram from desktop - Safari preferences" width="228" height="284" /><p id="caption-attachment-1541" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of hbase.net.</p></div>
<p>Step 2: From the pop-up menu, select the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; tab. In this tab, check out the &#8220;Show Develop menu in menu bar&#8221; option.</p>
<div id="attachment_1542" style="width: 633px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1542" class="size-full wp-image-1542" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-show-develop-menu.jpg" alt="Safari - &quot;Show Develop Menu&quot;" width="623" height="401" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-show-develop-menu.jpg 623w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-show-develop-menu-300x193.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1542" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of hbase.net.</p></div>
<p>Step 3: Open up Instagram.com in your browser and enter in your login credentials. Once that&#8217;s done, select the &#8220;Develop&#8221; menu above your browser.</p>
<div id="attachment_1544" style="width: 575px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1544" class="size-full wp-image-1544" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-user-agent.png" alt="Safari - user agent" width="565" height="290" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-user-agent.png 565w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-user-agent-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1544" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of hbase.net.</p></div>
<h5>Step 4</h5>
<p>Click on the &#8220;User Agent&#8221; option and select the Apple device that best suits your preferences.</p>
<div id="attachment_1543" style="width: 583px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1543" class="size-full wp-image-1543" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-upload-photos.jpg" alt="Safari - uploading photos to Instagram from computer" width="573" height="598" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-upload-photos.jpg 573w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/use-instagram-from-desktop-hbasenet-safari-upload-photos-287x300.jpg 287w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1543" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy of hbase.net.</p></div>
<p>This should emulate the Instagram mobile interface on your screen, complete with the camera option to upload media from your Mac.The process should play out exactly as it does on mobile &#8211; with cropping, filtering, and captioning options.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is Gramista worth it? Read this Gramista review to learn if this tool is worth your time and money.Gramista claims to take your Instagram to the next level by automating activity on your account. It claims to be the absolute best Instagram bot out there.</p>
<p>In this review we&#8217;ll be covering a number of topics, such as: it&#8217;s price, safety, effectiveness, if it&#8217;s user friendly, and if there are any better alternatives out there.</p>
<p>Ready to know how this tool works?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>What is Gramista?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1577 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="257" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout.jpg 854w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout-300x128.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistaabout-768x328.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Gramista is an Instagram tool designed to automate activity on your account. It automates a number of actions, saving you a lot of time in the long run.</p>
<p>What this tool does is automate the tedious tasks such as Liking content and following profiles, allowing you to focus on other areas of your social media business.</p>
<h2>How Gramista Works</h2>
<p>Gramista is a little different than most Instagram bots. The system is based on the human curiosity and reciprocity. In simple terms, the tool is built on people&#8217;s need to return the favor.</p>
<p>For example, when you like someone&#8217;s post on Instagram, they&#8217;ll probably return the favor by liking one of your posts. Gramista aims to send out a lot of these little pings, in the form of likes and follows, in hopes that the target profiles will do the same. As it turns out, most people will return the favor.</p>
<p>Their core service is called &#8220;Liker&#8221; which is based on this principle.</p>
<p>(Kicksta uses a similar service, <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/kickstagram/" data-wpel-link="internal">read our Kicksta review here</a>)</p>
<p>On that note, Gramista doesn&#8217;t straight-up spam profiles will comments, likes, messages, and all sorts of actions. It uses calculated algorithms to simulate human behavior, not spam. It&#8217;s important to understand the difference. There&#8217;s a mode called Smart Mode that uses AI to simulate human actions.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of Instagram bots make the same promises.</p>
<p>Does this one <em>really</em> work?</p>
<h2>Do You Have to Download Gramista?</h2>
<p>I understand downloading Instagram tools can be bothersome. The good news is Gramista works completely in your web-browser, and you don&#8217;t have to have the window open for it to work.</p>
<p>No need to download and install any programs. It makes things a lot easier because you don&#8217;t have to worry about virtual private servers and what not.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering:</p>
<h2>What are Gramista&#8217;s Prices?</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1582 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="271" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages.jpg 1112w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages-300x135.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages-768x347.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistasinglepackages-1024x462.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Gramista uses an interesting pricing structure. Instead of the usual monthly subscriptions, Gramista has a wide range of time-based single packages.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the list of packages:</p>
<ol>
<li>1 Day &#8211; $1.79</li>
<li>3 Days &#8211; $4.99</li>
<li>7 Days &#8211; $10.99</li>
<li>30 Days &#8211; $39.99</li>
<li>60 Days &#8211; $64.99</li>
<li>90 Days &#8211; $89.99</li>
</ol>
<h2>Does Gramista Have a Free Trial?</h2>
<p>The good news is Gramista does offer a free trial, although it&#8217;s not as long as other Instagram tools. With Gramista, the free trial lasts for 12 hours, and the countdown starts as soon as you link your Instagram account.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the option to buy a one or three day package, which is usually enough to test out the tool and see if it works. The one day package is essentially a free trial because it only costs $1.79.</p>
<h3>The Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Before I get into the tool&#8217;s features, I wanted to take a moment to share the internet&#8217;s opinion of Gramista.</p>
<p>Taking a look at their Trust Pilot page, the reviews don&#8217;t look good. It has a two out of five star rating with 90% of users rating it Bad or one star.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1477 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="508" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot.jpg 909w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot-300x254.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistatrustpilot-768x650.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>Granted, at the moment, there are only 10 reviews on that page. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s clear the tool doesn&#8217;t have the best reputation online.</p>
<p>On that note, the Trust Pilot page hasn&#8217;t been claimed by the company either, so it&#8217;s unclear if they even care about their online reputation.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll discuss the possible reasons for the negativity later on in the cons section of this Gramista review.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s move on to Gramista&#8217;s features:</p>
<h2>Gramista&#8217;s Features</h2>
<p>Gramista automates three actions: Likes, Follows, and Unfollow (the last two are bundled together).</p>
<p>Note: <em>The Liking service is called &#8220;Liker&#8221;. </em></p>
<p>These two services can be toggled on and off in the main dashboard, and you can also set the desired speed (Slow, Normal, and Fast).</p>
<p>What Liker does is what you imagine, it likes a wide range of content that falls within the parameters you specify with the target filters.</p>
<p>When used with appropriate targets, this service is supposed to be enough to quickly boost your Instagram audience. There are also a couple other features, such as Boost and Smart Mode.</p>
<p>Note: Speaking of likes, wondering <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-instagram-likes/" data-wpel-link="internal">how to get more likes on Instagram? </a></p>
<p>Before you start using these services, you&#8217;ll want to set up a target audience.</p>
<h3>Targeting Options</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1580 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="356" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags.jpg 892w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags-300x178.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hashtags-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>With Gramista, there are three ways to target profiles: Hashtags, Usernames, and Locations.</p>
<p>Almost everyone adds hashtags to their new posts, so that&#8217;s one way to find plenty of content. The Username filter will interact with the followers of a target username, instead of that specific username. It&#8217;s a good way to keep up with your competition.</p>
<p>And Location works as you would imagine, a decent filter for building local brands and what not. There&#8217;s also filter for Gender, as well as blacklists.</p>
<p>Once you setup accurate and specific targets, the only thing left to do is enable the services. Gramista will take it from there, and the Liker tool will start liking all the content related to your targets.</p>
<p>And the follow and unfollow tool will quietly work in the background.</p>
<h3>Follow &amp; Unfollow</h3>
<p>At Gramista, these two are bundled together,and run automatically in user-specified cycles. You can choose to run this service in Smart Mode, which is a recommended option, enabled by default.</p>
<p>The Smart Mode is an anti-spam filter mode. It basically creates random patterns for the scripts, instead of running them all in a row, which is easy for Instagram to detect. It also remembers which accounts you followed with the tool so you don&#8217;t keep interacting with the same accounts, not to mention a few other behind-the-scenes tasks.</p>
<p>The Smart Mode service works in cycles, following a batch, and then unfollowing the people who don&#8217;t follow back. An interesting feature is you can manually change the cycle periods in the settings menu, although the default settings are usually enough.</p>
<p>Cycles are basically limits. I always recommend keeping the bot limits as low as possible, at least as first. It&#8217;s better to be on the safe side. The default value for the cycles is 1,000 users but I recommend lowering it 100 or even lower.</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry!</p>
<h3>What About Boost?</h3>
<p>Boost is a service that does exactly what you would expect. It basically adds a quick injection of likes and activity to improve exposure on your posts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an optional service. And only recommended for older accounts. The good news is it can&#8217;t be enabled all the time, it only runs for 1 &#8211; 2 hours, and then has a 24 hour cool-down period before you can use it again.</p>
<p>Now that you have a basic idea what this tool can do, let&#8217;s run through the pros and cons.</p>
<h2>Gramista Review: Pros &amp; Cons</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the pros.</p>
<h3>Simple &amp; User-Friendly 👍</h3>
<p>One thing I really liked about this tool is the simplicity. There are really only two main services you need to know about, and you don&#8217;t need to manually input any limits or settings.</p>
<p>The default settings are usually good enough to start with. Basically, the only thing you need to do is sign-in with your Instagram account and toggle the two services. That&#8217;s it. Very easy to use.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also web-based.</p>
<h3>Budget-Friendly &amp; Flexible Packages 👍</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, the team at Gramista made their packages extremely accessible. There packages for people on a tight budget as well as for people working with more substantial funds.</p>
<p>What I really liked is not only can you sign-up for a 12-hour free trial, but you also buy  short periods of time, such as one day, or three days, for only a  few dollars. Very nice.</p>
<p>On the subject of prices, their refund policy is they do not entertain refund requests unless there is clear evidence that the tool is not working as promised. In other words, if you have an account and everything is working fine, they won&#8217;t give you a refund.</p>
<h3>Not Too Aggressive 👍</h3>
<p>Although the tool does have the Boost mode, it has a cool-down timer, so it can&#8217;t be overused. I liked how Gramista has a lot of anti-spam filters in place, which may be why they&#8217;re service is still operational when many similar companies are going down.</p>
<p>Their core service is based on liking content, that&#8217;s it. Actually, the following service is completely optional. As we know, Instagram won&#8217;t ban you for liking too much content.</p>
<p>So for those of you who are wondering if Gramista is safe, I have to say it looks quite safe to me. They also have a sleep mode which shuts the scripts off during the night-time in whichever timezone you select.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably one of the safer Instagram manager tools out there.</p>
<h3>Recent Activity Feed 👍</h3>
<p>Wondering what the tool is doing behind the scenes? In the dashboard you can find a Recent Activity feed that will show a real-time action-feed of your account.</p>
<p>For example, it shows who the bot followed, what content it liked, if it&#8217;s taking a break, and what not. A great way to keep an eye on your activity!</p>
<h3>Not a Great Reputation Online 👎</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s clear the company doesn&#8217;t have a great reputation online.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to find their official Instagram account, and their Twitter page hasn&#8217;t been updated in over two years. Speaking of their Twitter, there are a lot of people complaining on Twitter, but Gramista hasn&#8217;t even replied to any of them.</p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that they aren&#8217;t trying to claim the Trust Pilot page and resolve the complaints is a little suspicious to me. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. But it looks like they&#8217;re not too concerned with their reputation.</p>
<p>Also their blog is updated once every few months:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1578 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistablog.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="537" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistablog.jpg 704w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/gramistablog-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></p>
<p>It looks like their customer service in general is rather slow. Most of the people who complain about their customer service said they emailed the team multiple times and never got a response.</p>
<h3>Uses &#8220;Gram&#8221; in Their Name 👎</h3>
<p>Although not a major deal breaker, many similar tools have been shutdown for using words that Instagram has trademarked.</p>
<p>Take a look at this screenshot taken from <a href="https://en.instagram-brand.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram&#8217;s brand policies</a>:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1572 " src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagrambrandguidelines.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="421" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagrambrandguidelines.jpg 634w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/instagrambrandguidelines-300x211.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter of time before Instagram get on their case about it. If that happens, you can be sure they&#8217;ll shutdown instantly, taking your campaigns with them.</p>
<h3>Unreliable 👎</h3>
<p>It looks like a lot of people have encountered this issue. From what I can tell, the tool works great for the first few days, and then the performance starts going downhill, sometimes stopping completely. It&#8217;s frustrating to pay for a tool the stops working after a few days.</p>
<p>It looks like the activity can stop randomly and there&#8217;s no way to get it started again, even after contacting their support team. In short, when it works, it works good. But it doesn&#8217;t always work.</p>
<h2>Gramista Review Conclusion: Any Alternatives?</h2>
<p>Overall, I think Gramista is an okay tool. The Liker service is interesting enough and has potential. But I don&#8217;t get a good feeling from their customer support and it looks like a lot of people are running into issues with the tool. At the moment, I feel like Gramista is not good enough to recommend. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t recommend it.</p>
<h3><strong>Alternatives</strong></h3>
<p>We won&#8217;t leave you hanging here. There are plenty of <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">other Instagram managers</a> that we do recommend, two of which are listed below:</p>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji</a></h3>
<p>Kenji is a great little Instagram bot. It&#8217;s budget-friendly, fast, and safe. What more could you want? They also have a three day trial you can take advantage of without entering your credit card information.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Now Upleap is a little pricier because it&#8217;s not &#8211; technically &#8211; a bot. Upleap hires actual social media managers to take over your accounts and automate activity. It&#8217;s a really cool platform, that&#8217;s for sure. And you can also try it out for three days, for free, without any credit card details.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Gramista review! Hopefully now you have enough information to make the best decision for your business.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know if Hublaagram is worth it? Are there better alternatives? Hublaagram is an Instagram bot designed to get you more likes, followers, and comments.</p>
<p>You can choose to download the APK file for Android or install the web browser extension for Google or Firefox. It also looks like the company has plans to launch on the Apple store too.</p>
<p>Look:</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ll cut the chase. I didn&#8217;t have a good experience with Hublaagram. Not only was their service sub-par, but I encountered some strange pop-ups on their website. Not to mention a bunch of broken links. Suffice to say, I was not impressed.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re convinced Hublaagram is not worth it, I&#8217;ll share some of my favorite alternatives below.</p>
<h2>Our Favorite Hublaagram Alternatives</h2>
<h3><a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">1 &#8211; Kenji </a></h3>
<p>Kenji can be used to quickly build an audience on Instagram. The tool uses artificial intelligence to generate activity on your Instagram account.</p>
<p>It also has tons of anti-spam filters, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about Instagram blocking your account. Kenji is also a great choice for budget marketers.</p>
<p>You can sign-up to their free 3-day trial to take it for a test run.</p>
<h3><a href="https://upleap.com/" data-wpel-link="internal">2 &#8211; Upleap</a></h3>
<p>Upleap&#8217;s slogan is, &#8220;Get More Instagram Followers with a Dedicated Account Manager&#8221;.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what the tool does. Instead of running scripts on your account, as most bots do, Upleap assigns a professional account manager to you. With this system, you can expect steady organic growth.</p>
<p>Upleap is a little more expensive, but if you&#8217;re serious about growing your social media accounts, it&#8217;s worth looking into.</p>
<p>The best part is they also offer a 3-day trial with no credit card required.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<h2>How Does Hublaagram Work?</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1770" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription.jpg" alt="" width="1546" height="358" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription.jpg 1546w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription-300x69.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription-768x178.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagramdescription-1024x237.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1546px) 100vw, 1546px" /></p>
<p>Curious to know how Hublaagram works and why we don&#8217;t recommend them?</p>
<p>To start with, finding accurate information about this app is rather difficult because they have many different websites that advertise a variety of features. It&#8217;s not clear which website is real. It also seems to go by the name Hublaa Helper.</p>
<p>From what I could gather, Hublaagram&#8217;s system is a little different. What the system does is exchange activity with other accounts every 10 minutes, such as followers, likes, and comments.</p>
<p>For example, you can choose to submit your followers to the platform, and then receive followers from other people submitting their followers. In other words, it&#8217;s like a crowd-sourced pool of Instagram activity. You put something in and get something back.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, that&#8217;s the main concept.</p>
<h2>Hublaagram&#8217;s Core Features</h2>
<p>If you manage to get through the spam, Hublaagram has a few core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instaliker</li>
<li>Instacomment</li>
<li>Instafollow</li>
</ul>
<p>They all work basically the same, exchanging activity with other members.</p>
<p>Instaliker is another way of saying buying Instagram likes.</p>
<p>What you do is choose the number of likes you want, and the post you want them on and hit purchase. It doesn&#8217;t interact with accounts like other apps, it straight up sends likes your post.</p>
<p>Speaking of Instagram likes, want to learn <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/get-instagram-likes/" data-wpel-link="internal">the best way to get Instagram likes? </a></p>
<p>And as you can imagine, the likes come from fake profiles.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing:</p>
<p>Most of the links on the website don&#8217;t work, so there&#8217;s no real way to test the app.</p>
<h3>Red Flags</h3>
<p>While testing out this app, I kept running into red-flags after red-flags.</p>
<h4>1 &#8211; Strange Pop-ups <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Now this one bothered me the most. I simply clicked on the link to watch a tutorial on how the tool works and my browser was redirected to an adult webcam website. Very unprofessional.</p>
<p>It happened every time I clicked on a link too. I&#8217;m not sure if that was intentional, or the website was hacked, either way, it&#8217;s inappropriate.</p>
<p>The other Hublaagram websites were riddled with spam too, either gambling sites or random squeeze pages for making money online.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I had ad-block enabled too.</p>
<h4>2 &#8211; Multiple Poorly Made Company Websites <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Another major red flag is the fact that the app has multiple websites with its name on it. And the funny part is they&#8217;re all equally as bad.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a list I managed to find, there may be more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hublaagram.to</li>
<li>Hublaagram.me</li>
<li>Instagramrealfollowers.com</li>
<li>Hublaagram.co.id</li>
</ul>
<p>The other websites also have lots of pop-ups and broken links. It&#8217;s clear the team behind Hublaagram isn&#8217;t very professional.</p>
<p>The Instagram Real Followers website has more information than the rest, but it&#8217;s insecure. And when you click on &#8220;Packages&#8221; you&#8217;re redirected to another website about buying Instagram likes.</p>
<p>Very strange.</p>
<h4>3 &#8211; Absolutely No Filters <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>To make matters worse, the tool provides absolutely no filters. It allows anyone to submit and receive followers for anyone. No way to vent followers.</p>
<p>What this means is you &#8211; more often than not &#8211; end up with tons of fake profiles, with no profile pictures, no bios, and a bunch of numbers in their user handle. Terrible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll take a long time to purge these accounts from your profile.</p>
<p>Getting more followers on Instagram is always nice, but if they do nothing for your business, it&#8217;s worthless.</p>
<h4>4 &#8211; Might Steal Your Password <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Based on what I have seen on the website, I&#8217;m sure Hublaagram is not a safe tool.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t give them the password to my main Instagram account, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>If their websites are riddled with spam, there&#8217;s a good chance they&#8217;ll steal your password and data.</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<h4>5 &#8211; APK Download Only <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s only the option to down their APK file which is unverified and a little risky.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not on Google Play or Apple, and their Chrome extension doesn&#8217;t work either.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1771" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror.jpg" alt="" width="854" height="314" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror.jpg 854w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror-300x110.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/googlestoreerror-768x282.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></p>
<p>In fact, it redirects to a broken link. The only way to access the app is via their APK download from a third-party website.</p>
<p>To do that, you&#8217;ll need to have an Android phone and enable unverified app installations on it.</p>
<p>Risky. Not recommended.</p>
<h4>6 &#8211; No About Page <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>Hublaagram&#8217;s websites do not reveal any information about who created the tool.</p>
<p>Actually, there&#8217;s hardly any information at all. It looks quite suspicious. Even the knowledge base is completely empty.</p>
<p>On one of their websites, they say &#8220;Hublaagram is not made by a single person but by Hublaagram Team who would like to stay anonymous&#8221;.</p>
<h4>7 &#8211; Official Hublaa Account on Twitter Has Two Tweets <span class="emoji">🚩</span></h4>
<p>I managed to find the company&#8217;s Twitter account, and it only has two Tweets.</p>
<p>On those Tweets, there are responses from Hublaagram users, most of which are saying the service does not work.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1740" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="594" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking.jpg 808w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-150x150.jpg 150w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-300x297.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-768x759.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notworking-60x60.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>Their second Tweet is asking for Facebook accounts because all of their accounts got banned.</p>
<p>If all their Facebook accounts got banned, do you really think your Instagram will be safe?</p>
<p>I know I wouldn&#8217;t want to take that risk.</p>
<h3 style="line-height: 1.84615; margin-top: 1.71429rem; margin-bottom: 1.71429rem; font-size: 1.14286rem;">How Much Does It Cost?</h3>
<p>You&#8217;re probably wondering how much Hublaagram costs.</p>
<p>Since there are multiple websites (and they all mention different services and prices) it&#8217;s hard to get a clear answer regarding the price.</p>
<p>From what I could tell, the core exchange service is free, but the Autoliker costs $20/month. The Autoliker sends new likes to your latest posts, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Look at this screenshot:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-1739" style="font-size: 1rem;" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership.jpg" alt="" width="601" height="298" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership.jpg 1355w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership-300x149.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership-768x381.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hublaagrammembership-1024x508.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" /></p>
<p>On another website, it claims to have three packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 one-time for Basic</li>
<li>$15 one-time.</li>
<li>$10/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is the sign-up button links don&#8217;t even work. Nothing happens when you click them.</p>
<h3>Anything Positive?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to be too negative here, but I was having a hard time finding anything to like about this tool.</p>
<p>One thing I could mention is it&#8217;s actually free. It&#8217;s not on a trial either, you can use it for free as much as you want if it ever works.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care so much about building a target audience, only numbers, then you could probably increase those numbers a bit with this tool.</p>
<p>On the other hand, building a targeted audience with this tool is practically impossible.</p>
<p>To me, I feel like it&#8217;s straight-up spam. Fake followers, Likes from fake accounts, and spam-like comments &#8211; nothing that will benefit a social media business.</p>
<p>Not sure how to build an authentic audience? <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/instagram-following/" data-wpel-link="internal">Read this.</a></p>
<h2>Our Conclusion: AVOID Hublaagram!</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret we promote our own Instagram tools, but even when it comes to a tool we don&#8217;t officially recommend, I usually say it&#8217;s worth trying out, at least.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t say that about Hublaagram. I really didn&#8217;t have a good experience with this app, and it didn&#8217;t even work for me. Not to mention all the weird pop-ups and spam.</p>
<p>I got the impression it was designed by a one-man team and abandoned because it&#8217;s half-done.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to avoid Hublaagram. It&#8217;s just too suspicious.</p>
<h2>Are There Any Hublaagram Alternatives?</h2>
<p>The two tools mentioned at the beginning of this article are a couple of great alternatives, <a href="https://kenji.ai/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kenji</a> and <a href="https://upleap.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Upleap</a>.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re not too keen on those, feel free to take a look at our <a href="https://socialfollow.co/blog/best-tools-for-instagram-managers/" data-wpel-link="internal">full list of recommended Instagram tools. </a></p>
<p>Honestly, there are lots of decent Instagram tools. My advice is to avoid the full-scale Instagram bots unless you know how to configure them with proxies and virtual private servers.</p>
<p>Stick a tool that doesn&#8217;t spam too much and keeps activity in the normal to moderate levels. It&#8217;s much safer, in the long run.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this Hublaagram review.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interested in Instagram live? You should be.</p>
<p>Live video is bigger than ever.</p>
<p>It started with Facebook Live, giving companies a chance to connect with their customers through raw, authentic video content.</p>
<p>As people reacted positively to the arrival of this new concept, other social media channels followed suit, giving users the option to broadcast whenever, and whatever they wanted. These days, around 80% of consumers say that they&#8217;d <a href="https://www.go-globe.com/blog/live-streaming-statistics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">rather watch a live video</a> from a company than read a blog.</p>
<p>Live video is an excellent way to show your customers your genuine side with authentic, unedited material. Additionally, because live videos can only be &#8220;live&#8221; for a certain amount of time, they encourage feelings of &#8220;FOMO&#8221; in your audience. In other words, people don&#8217;t want to miss out on being part of the &#8220;in&#8221; crowd, so they&#8217;re more likely to join in.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s everything you need to know about how to go live on Instagram.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-927 size-medium" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Instagram-Live-300x259.jpg" alt="Using Instagram Live" width="300" height="259" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Instagram-Live-300x259.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Instagram-Live.jpg 545w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>The Benefits of Using Instagram Live for Your Business</h2>
<p>Before we start covering the basics of how to use Instagram live, let&#8217;s take a look at the reasons why you&#8217;d want to use this feature, to begin with.</p>
<p>After all, you&#8217;ve probably already spent months getting used to Instagram videos and Instagram Stories, adding yet another thing to your strategy is no simple feat.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Instagram Live is an excellent way to boost discoverability and engagement online. It delivers the benefits of video marketing, like <a href="http://v1.aberdeen.com/launch/report/research_report/12472-RR-Video-Marketing-Growth-AM.asp" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">66% more qualified leads</a> per year, along with opportunities to improve customer/brand relationships.</p>
<p>Like Instagram Stories and standard Insta posts, the more engagement you encourage with your content, the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll end up on the Instagram Explore page &#8211; which means that you connect with a wider number of people.</p>
<p>Starting an Instagram live video campaign can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve your visibility: It&#8217;s often difficult to manipulate the Instagram algorithm in a way that gets you plenty of attention from your target audience. However, Instagram Live sends push notifications to anyone that follows your account, improving your chances of interaction.</li>
<li>Increase engagement levels: Instagram Live brings followers closer to you by allowing you to respond to their questions and comments in real-time. It&#8217;s the closest your followers can come to having a face-to-face conversation with you.</li>
<li>Develop brand loyalty: The connections you make through Instagram Live will help to strengthen the relationships that customers have with your company. These relationships improve your chances of brand loyalty too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Starting an Instagram Live Video: The Basics</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s get to how to go live on Instagram.</p>
<p>Starting an Instagram Live video is simpler than you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>Open your Instagram app and click on the camera in the top left corner. You can also access the camera feature by swiping right. Here, you&#8217;ll be able to visit the &#8220;Stories&#8221; section of Instagram, which comes with a carousel at the bottom of the page with words like &#8220;Boomerang,&#8221; &#8220;Normal&#8221; &#8220;Rewind,&#8221; and &#8220;Hands-free.&#8221; What you want is &#8220;Live.&#8221;</p>
<p>When you reach &#8220;Live&#8221; you&#8217;ll see a big white button, but you don&#8217;t need to tap on that until you&#8217;re ready to start live streaming. You&#8217;ll also be able to switch out which camera you&#8217;re using by tapping the arrows to the right side of the button.</p>
<p>Before you move forward with starting an Instagram live video, check your Instagram stories settings. This will help you to outline whether you want to hide your live videos from specific people and if you want to save your video after it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Instagram only gives you a 3-second countdown before launching your Livestream. That means that you need to be ready to start recording straight away.</p>
<p>Your broadcast will be limited to one hour, but you&#8217;ll have to keep an eye on your data and battery life limitations with your smartphone too.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-928 aligncenter" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Instagram-live-images-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Instagram-live-images-300x169.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Instagram-live-images.jpg 711w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>Managing your Instagram Live Broadcast</h2>
<p>One of the great things about Instagram Live is that as soon as you go live, all of your followers and friends will be instantly informed with a pop-up notification. They&#8217;ll also be able to see a &#8220;Live&#8221; badge on your profile picture at the top of their Instagram feed.</p>
<p>The more you learn about how to go live on Instagram, the easier it will be to adjust your broadcasting strategy to give you the best possible return on investment. However, when you&#8217;re just beginning, it&#8217;s a good idea to keep the following things in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can control your viewers: If you don&#8217;t want everyone to get a pop-up notification when you go Live, you can hide your video from specific users. Go into your profile settings and select &#8220;Story Settings.&#8221; Tap on &#8220;Hide Story From&#8221; to choose who you don&#8217;t want to see your live videos.</li>
<li>Moderating comments is easy: If you&#8217;d rather avoid having inappropriate words popping up in the comments section, you can turn on comment moderation. However, this isn&#8217;t a good idea if you want to get a lot of engagement for your brand.</li>
<li>See who&#8217;s watching: Remember that you can keep an eye on who&#8217;s tuning into your Instagram live broadcast by tapping on the eye icon at the top left-hand corner of your screen. If you start to notice the same viewers tuning in every time, give them a shout-out on your next broadcast to show how much you appreciate them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Go Live on Instagram: Creating a Strategy</h2>
<p>Understanding how to go Live on Instagram successfully isn&#8217;t just about knowing how to use the feature. You&#8217;ll also need a strategy in place to make sure that you&#8217;re getting the most out of your broadcasts. After all, like any other Instagram feature, Live requires careful planning if you&#8217;re going to use it correctly.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways you can make the most out of Instagram Live.</p>
<h2>1.     Know the Purpose of your Instagram Live Broadcast</h2>
<p>Every piece of content you share online, whether it&#8217;s a live video, a blog, or just a picture on Instagram, needs to have a purpose. With that in mind, think carefully about why you&#8217;re going to be using Live in the first place. Some of the best ways to take advantage of this feature include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revealing new products: Build up anticipation for new arrivals in your portfolio, then broadcast your big-reveal in real-time.</li>
<li>Go behind the scenes: Help people get to know your company a little better with authentic behind-the-scenes content. You could even introduce them to other members of your team.</li>
<li>Interview a special guest: Reach out to partners and influencers in your industry that would be interested in creating a video with you.</li>
<li>Run a Q&amp;A: Answer any pressing questions that your customers have about your product or service with a question and answers session.</li>
<li>Ask for feedback: Talk about a new product or service with your customers and ask them to give you their honest opinion.</li>
<li>Share a tutorial: If your followers are always asking for help on figuring out how to make the most of your product or service, give them some guidance with a tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brainstorm a few different ideas at once when you&#8217;re planning on doing an Instagram Live broadcast, and you&#8217;ll make sure that you always have a range of options to choose from.</p>
<h2>2.     Make Sure that You&#8217;re Prepared</h2>
<p>Starting an Instagram Live video campaign can be a daunting and nerve-wracking experience. Make sure that you&#8217;re ready by getting yourself prepared. Live videos are often more worrisome than most forms of video content because there&#8217;s always a chance that you can fumble something, trip over your words, or make a mistake that you can&#8217;t simply edit out.</p>
<p>Mistakes in your stream won&#8217;t necessarily be the end of the world for your company. Remember that people are looking for evidence that you&#8217;re a genuine and authentic brand. However, it&#8217;s worth practicing your video script beforehand and <a href="https://www.oberlo.co.uk/blog/definitive-guide-instagram-live-video-businesses" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">looking for anything you can improve</a>. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you change the background to something more professional?</li>
<li>Is your audio clear, and does your image look great?</li>
<li>Are you comfortable with your topic, or do you need to do more research?</li>
<li>Are your lighting and camera angles adequately established?</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-929 size-medium" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Millie-BB-Instagram-300x200.jpg" alt="Instagram live screenshot" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Millie-BB-Instagram-300x200.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Millie-BB-Instagram.jpg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>3.     Promote your Instagram Live Streams in Advance</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that you&#8217;re not just using Instagram Live for the sake of it &#8211; you&#8217;re trying to boost engagement and get more followers for your brand. With that in mind, you need to ensure that people are anticipating your stream, so you have the best chances of a good turnout.</p>
<p>Think about how you can promote your broadcast before it&#8217;s going to happen. For instance, can you share Instagram Stories that tell people about what you&#8217;re going to cover in your video? What about posting pictures on your Instagram feed with plenty of hashtags to improve your chances of making it <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-explore/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">to the Explore page</a>?</p>
<p>Some people even find that it&#8217;s helpful to promote their upcoming Instagram Live broadcast on other channels, particularly if they have more followers on other social profiles. If you&#8217;re just getting started with Instagram, sharing news about your broadcast on your website, or Facebook might lead to a better viewer count.</p>
<h2>4.     Use FOMO to Your Advantage</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, one of the best things about Instagram Live broadcasts is that they only last for a short period. They&#8217;re not going to be around forever, and that means that you have a great opportunity to take advantage of your customer&#8217;s &#8220;Fear of Missing Out&#8221;. FOMO is a common part of many marketing strategies today.</p>
<p>To use FOMO in your Instagram live videos, ask yourself what you can do to get people hyped about viewing your content as it happens. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you announce exclusive news that people can&#8217;t get anywhere else? People love feeling like they&#8217;re the first to be in the know.</li>
<li>Could you offer one-time-only promotional codes that only last for the length of your Livestream? This is a fantastic way to convince your audience that they should always attend your streams.</li>
<li>Will you be able to show your audience something they can&#8217;t see elsewhere? For instance, designer Tim Coppens once used Instagram Live to showcase a new menswear collection before it launched online.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-930 size-medium" src="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tim-coppens-instagram-300x190.jpg" alt="Instagram Live technique by @timcoppens" width="300" height="190" srcset="https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tim-coppens-instagram-300x190.jpg 300w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tim-coppens-instagram-768x485.jpg 768w, https://socialfollow.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tim-coppens-instagram.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<h2>5.     Follow up After your Video</h2>
<p>Finally, remember that starting an Instagram live video isn&#8217;t the only thing you need to think about if you want to be successful. You also need to know how to end your videos too. For instance, when the broadcast is finished, make sure that you tap the Save button to add the content to your library. This will mean that you can go back and learn from your broadcast later.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a good idea to check out your Live metrics, so you can figure out when people gained and lost interest in your video. This will help you to plan your future streams. Consider taking a screenshot of the metrics presented by Instagram Live so that you can use them later.</p>
<p>Additionally, remember to create a post-live Instagram story or Post to let people who didn&#8217;t make the stream know what they missed out on. You can also encourage them to hit the follow button and turn on push notifications, so they don&#8217;t miss your next broadcast.</p>
<h2>Ready to Go Live?</h2>
<p>Instagram is one of the most exciting and user-friendly platforms available for brands today. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to increase engagement for your company and drive attention to your organization, then you can&#8217;t go wrong with Instagram.</p>
<p>The Instagram Live feature is just another item in your toolkit that you can use to connect with your audience and boost your chances of long-term success. With the tips above, you should have everything you need to dive into starting an Instagram live video with confidence.</p>
